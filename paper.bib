	abstract={ Sampling based planners have become increasingly efficient in solving the problems of classical motion planning and its applications. In particular, techniques based on the rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) have generated highly successful single-query planners. Recently, a variant of this planner called dynamic-domain RRT was introduced by Yershova et al. (2005). It relies on a new sampling scheme that improves the performance of the RRT approach on many motion planning problems. One of the drawbacks of this method is that it introduces a new parameter that requires careful tuning. In this paper we analyze the influence of this parameter and propose a new variant of the dynamic-domain RRT, which iteratively adapts the sampling domain for the Voronoi region of each node during the search process. This allows automatic tuning of the parameter and significantly increases the robustness of the algorithm. The resulting variant of the algorithm has been tested on several path planning problems.},

	abstract={Randomly expanding trees are very effective in exploring high-dimensional spaces. Consequently, they are a powerful algorithmic approach to sampling-based single-query motion planning. As the dimensionality of the configuration space increases, however, the performance of tree-based planners that use uniform expansion degrades. To address this challenge, we present a utility-guided algorithm for the online adaptation of the random tree expansion strategy. This algorithm guides expansion towards regions of maximum utility based on local characteristics of state space. To guide exploration, the algorithm adjusts the parameters that control random tree expansion in response to state space information obtained during the planning process. We present experimental results to demonstrate that the resulting single-query planner is computationally more efficient and more robust than previous planners in challenging artificial and real-world environments.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm which extends the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) framework to handle manipulation planning. This is done by using a two level approach, a PRM of PRMs. The first level builds a manipulation graph, whose nodes represent stable placements of the manipulated objects while the edges represent transfer and transit actions. The actual motion planning for the transfer and transit paths is done by PRM planners at the second level. The approach is made possible by the introduction of a new kind of roadmap, called the fuzzy roadmap. The fuzzy roadmap contains edges which are not verified by a local planner during construction. Instead, each edge is assigned a number which represents the probability that it is feasible. Later, if the edge is part of a solution path, the edge is checked for collisions. The overall effect is that our roadmaps evolve iteratively until they contain a solution. The use of fuzzy roadmaps in both levels of our manipulation planner offers many advantages. At the first level, a fuzzy roadmap represents the manipulation graph and addresses the problem of having probabilistically complete planners at the second level. At the second level, fuzzy roadmaps drastically reduce the number of collision checks. The paper contains experimental results demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our scheme.},

In this paper we introduce FastDTW, an approximation of DTW that has a linear time and space complexity. FastDTW uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarser resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically. We also analyze the accuracy of FastDTW by comparing it to two other types of existing approximate DTW algorithms: constraints (such as Sakoe-Chiba Bands) and abstraction. Our results show a large improvement in accuracy over existing methods.},

@article{citeulike:494149,
	abstract = {This paper aims to present a review of recent as well as classic image registration methods. Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},

Firstly, a path planning method dealing with localization uncertainties is proposed, where the uncertainties in both position and orientation of a non-holonomic mobile robot are considered. The safety of this method is due to the mixing of the planning phase and the navigation phase sing the same process of localization (the Kalman filter). Secondly, while previous works planned safe paths in the configuration space, we show that it is necessary to plan safe paths in an uncertain-configuration space. Then, we introduce the novel concept of "towers of uncertainties" and show the effectiveness of this concept with an example.},

It then computes so-called "polar obstacle densities" for the cells in the traversability map and transforms the traversability map into a traversability field histogram, from which the velocity and the steering command for the robot are determined. Simulation results show that the algorithm is able to navigate the robot to the target with a finite-length path.},

			exploration on the less covered parts of this boundary. Extensive
			experiments show KPIECE provides computational gain over
			state-of-the-art methods and allows solving some harder, previously

It is designed to find paths in high-dimensional continuous spaces and applies to robots with many degrees of freedom in static, as well as dynamic environments --- ones where obstacles may move. The Ariadne's clew algorithm comprises two sub-algorithms, called SEARCH and EXPLORE, applied in an interleaved manner. EXPLORE builds a representation of the accessible space while SEARCH looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems. We describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle. Experimental results show that a path is found in about one second without any pre-processing.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the Discrete Search Leading
		continuous eXploration (DSLX) planner, a multi-resolution
			approach to motion planning that is suitable for challenging
			problems involving robots with kinodynamic constraints. Initially
			the method decomposes the workspace to build a graph that
			encodes the physical adjacency of the decomposed regions. This
			graph is searched to obtain leads, that is, sequences of regions that
			can be explored with sampling-based tree methods to generate
			solution trajectories. Instead of treating the discrete search of
			the adjacency graph and the exploration of the continuous state
			space as separate components, DSLX passes information from
			one to the other in innovative ways. Each lead suggests what
			regions to explore and the exploration feeds back information
			to the discrete search to improve the quality of future leads.
			Information is encoded in edge weights, which indicate the
			importance of including the regions associated with an edge in
			the next exploration step. Computation of weights, leads, and the
			actual exploration make the core loop of the algorithm.

			Extensive experimentation shows that DSLX is very versatile.
			The discrete search can drastically change the lead to reflect
			new information allowing DSLX to find solutions even when
			sampling-based tree planners get stuck. Experimental results on
			a variety of challenging kinodynamic motion planning problems
			show computational speedups of two orders of magnitude over
			other widely used motion planning methods.},

When the differential constraints of a real robot are also modelled, the produced motions can be more realistic and make better use of the hardware{\textquoteright}s capabilities. While it is not known if planning under differential constraints is a decidable problem and complete tractable algorithms are not available, sampling-based planners have been very successful at solving such problems. This thesis describes an online planning strategy which uses a sampling-based planner in a loop. Solutions for problems in static and known environments are computed incrementally through consecutive replanning steps. The robot is guided to the goal by a navigation function which is constantly updated to ensure the robot can explore all of its workspace. Experiments on various systems and workspaces show that the proposed approach can solve harder problems and produce paths of shorter duration compared to state-of-the art offline planners using only bounded memory.},

	year = {2008},
	school = {Rice University},
	address = {Houston, TX},
	abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental algorithmic problem that attracts attention because of its importance in many exciting applications, such as controlling robots or virtual agents in simulations and computer games. While there has been great progress over the last decades in solving high-dimensional geometric problems there are still many challenges that limit the capabilities of existing solutions. In particular, it is important to effectively model and plan for systems with complex dynamics and significant drift (kinodynamic planning). An additional requirement is that realistic systems and agents must safely operate in a real-time fashion (replanning), with partial knowledge of their surroundings (partial observability) and despite the presence or in collaboration with other moving agents (distributed planning). This thesis describes techniques that address challenges related to real-time motion planning while focusing on systems with non-trivial dynamics. The first contribution is a new kinodynamic planner, termed Informed Subdivision Tree (IST), that incorporates heuristics to solve motion planning queries more effectively while achieving the theoretical guarantee of probabilistic completeness. The thesis proposes also a general methodology to construct heuristics for kinodynamic planning based on configuration space knowledge through a roadmap-based approach. Then this thesis investigates replanning problems, where a planner is called periodically given a predefined amount of time. In this scenario, safety concerns arise by the presence of both dynamic motion constraints and time limitations. The thesis proposes the framework of Short-Term Safety Replanning (STSR), which achieves safety guarantees in this context while minimizing computational overhead. The final contribution corresponds to an extension of the STSR framework in distributed planning, where multiple agents communicate to safely avoid collisions despite their dynamic constraints. The proposed algorithms are tested on simulated systems with interesting dynamics, including physically simulated systems. Such experiments correspond to the state-of-the-art in terms of system modeling for motion planning. The experiments show that the proposed techniques outperform existing alternatives, where available, and emphasize their computational advantages.},

These planners randomly sample the configuration space, building up a roadmap that connects the samples. A major problem is finding valid configurations in tight areas, and many methods have been proposed to more effectively sample these regions. By constructing a skeleton-like subset of the free regions of the workspace, these heuristics can be strengthened. The skeleton provides a concise description of the workspace topology and an efficient means of finding points with maximal clearance from the obstacles. We examine the medial axis as a skeleton, including a method to compute an approximation to it. The medial axis is a two-equidistant surface in the workspace. We form a heuristic for finding difficult configurations using the medial axis, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a planner for rigid objects in a 3D workspace.},

It is a sampling-based method which builds a tree and takes a substantially different approach from other exploration planners such as RRT [18] and EST [12]. PDST-EXPLORE is a general purpose planner but is designed to overcome difficulties inherent in planning for robots with non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, our planner represents samples as path segments rather than individual states and uses non-uniform subdivisions of the state space to estimate coverage. This change avoids many of the problems that previous sampling-based planners have had with milestone placement, metrics and coverage estimation. We use a deterministic update schedule together with randomized path generation to adaptively strike a balance between greedy exploration and methodical search. We have obtained a proof of probabilistic completeness for the planner which assumes very little about the specific robot system that the planner operates on. Finally, we have implemented the planner for planar kinodynamic point robots, differential drive robots and blimp-like robots. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the planner{\textquoteright}s implementation as well as its robustness in covering the entire reachable free space.

We show that PSs calculated with Laguerre-Gauss filters contain important information and provide a useful tool for image analysis. PSs are invariant to image translation and rotation. We introduce several invariant features to characterize the core structures around PSs and analyze the stability of PSs to noise addition and scale change. We also study the characteristics of PSs in a scale space, which lead to a method to select key scales along phase singularity curves. We demonstrate two applications of PSs: object tracking and image matching. In object tracking, we use the iterative closest point algorithm to determine the correspondences of PSs between two adjacent frames. The use of PSs allows us to precisely determine the motions of tracked objects. In image matching, we combine PSs and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor to deal with the variations between two images and examine the proposed method on a benchmark database. The results indicate that our method can find more correct matching pairs with higher repeatability rates than some well-known methods.},

Yet when such a planner fails to find a path, it is not clear that no path exists, or that the planner simply did not sample adequately or intelligently the free part of the configuration space. We propose to attack the motion planning problem from the other end, focusing on disconnection proofs, or proofs showing that there exists no solution to the posed motion planning problem. Just as PRM planners avoid generating a complete description of the configuration space, our disconnection provers search for certain special classes of proofs that are compact and easy to find when the motion planning problem is 'obviously impossible," avoiding complex geometric and combinatorial calculations. We demonstrate such a prover in action for a simple, yet still realistic, motion planning problem. When it fails, the prover suggests key milestones, or configurations of the robot that can then be passed on and used by a PRM planner. Thus by hitting the motion planning problem from both ends, we hope to resolve the existence of a path, except in truly delicate border-line situations.},

The suggested approach converts the gradient guidance field from a harmonic potential to a control signal by augmenting it with a novel type of damping forces called nonlinear, anisotropic, damping forces (NADFs). The combination of the two provides a signal that can both guide a robot and effectively manage its dynamics. The kinodynamic planning signal inherits the guidance capabilities of the harmonic gradient field. It can also be easily configured to efficiently suppress the inertia-induced transients in the robot's trajectory without compromising the speed of operation. The approach works with dissipative systems as well as systems acted on by external forces without needing the full knowledge of the systemÂ??s dynamics. Theoretical developments and simulation results are provided in this article.},

A car seat fitted with an 8 × 8 matrix of vibrators embedded in the seat pan was used to code eight different directions. Localization response time and angular accuracy were examined as a function of stimulus direction, presence of a tactile attention cue, temporal pattern, stimulus layout, age, and gender. The mean absolute angular error was 23°, and both localization accuracy and response times were superior for the back left, backward, and back right directions. Of the various temporal pattern/attention cue combinations examined, results favored the relatively fast patterns consisting of vibration bursts of 125 or 250 ms without a centrally located attention cue over 500 ms bursts that were preceded by an attention cue. Observed age and gender effects were relatively modest, suggesting that using tactile cueing to communicate direction is effective across a wide range of users. In addition, the tactile stimulus was detected by more than 90\% of the participants under surprise trial conditions. Overall, these results indicate that the tactile chair provides a promising and robust method of providing directional information.",

	abstract={Path planning for robots with many degrees of freedom (dof) receives continuous interest in both robotics and computer graphics communities. A variety of random sampling-based methods have been proposed to solve the path planning problems in high-dimensional configuration space, including Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs). However, the efficiency will be dramatically decreased when plenty of narrow passages exist far away from initial and goal configurations. In this paper, a novel Multi-RRTs framework is presented to rapidly capture the connectivity of narrow passages formed by nearby obstacles. The algorithm improves a sampling algorithm called Bridge Test to find global important roadmaps that identify the critical regions, based on which a Multi-RRTs structure is constructed to incrementally explore unknown configuration space. Combined with global heuristics and local connection, the method is shown to be more effective, and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the method.},

The estimation takes into account (1) the amount of overlap between the surfaces, (2) the noise in the surface points' positions, and (3) the geometric constraint on the 3D rigid-body transformation between the two surfaces. Given a required confidence level, the method of estimation enables us to predetermine the registration accuracy of two overlapping surfaces. This is very useful for automated range acquisition planning where it is important to ensure that the next scan to be acquired can be registered to the previous scans within the desired accuracy. We demonstrate a view-planning system that incorporates our estimation method in the selection of good candidate views for the range acquisition of indoor environments.},

We developed a new error function to compare the input range image to pre-computed range maps of the 3D model. We use the tremendous data- parallel processing performance of modern graphics hardware to evaluate and minimize the error function on many range images in parallel.

	abstract={In order to construct three dimensional shape models of large scale architectures by a laser range finder, a number of range images are normally taken from various viewpoints and these images are aligned using post-processing procedure such as ICP algorithm. However in general, before applying ICP algorithm, these range images have to be registered to correct positions roughly by a human operator in order to converge to precise positions. In addition, range images must be overlapped sufficiently each other by taking dense images from close viewpoints. On the other hand, if poses of the laser range finder at viewpoints can be identified precisely, local range images can be converted to the world coordinate system directly with simple transformation calculation. This paper proposes a new measurement system for large scale architectures using a group of multiple robots and an on-board laser range finder. Each measurement position is identified by the highly precise positioning technique named cooperative positioning system or CPS which utilizes the characteristics of multiple robots system. The proposed system can construct 3D shapes of large scale architectures without any post-processing procedure such as ICP algorithm and dense range measurements. The measurement experiments in unknown and large indoor/outdoor environments are successfully carried out using the newly developed measurement system consisting of three mobile robots named CPS-V.},

		This paper presents a Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) motion planning algorithm to be queried within Dynamic Robot Networks--a multi-robot coordination platform for robots operating with limited sensing and inter-robot communication.
		First, the Dynamic Robot Networks (DRN) coordination platform is introduced that facilitates centralized robot coordination across ad hoc networks, allowing safe navigation in dynamic, unknown environments. As robots move about their environment, they dynamically form communication networks. Within these networks, robots can share local sensing information and coordinate the actions of all robots in the network.
		Second, a fast single-query Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) to be called within the DRN platform is presented that has been augmented with new sampling strategies. Traditional PRM strategies have shown success in searching large configuration spaces. Considered here is their application to on-line, centralized, multiple mobile robot planning problems. New sampling strategies that exploit the kinematics of non-holonomic mobile robots have been developed and implemented. First, an appropriate method of selecting milestones in a PRM is identified to enable fast coverage of the configuration space. Second, a new method of generating PRM milestones is described that decreases the planning time over traditional methods. Finally, a new endgame region for multi-robot PRMs is presented that increases the likelihood of finding solutions given difficult goal configurations.
		Combining the DRN platform with these new sampling strategies, on-line centralized multi-robot planning is enabled. This allows robots to navigate safely in environments that are both dynamic and unknown. Simulations and real robot experiments are presented that demonstrate: (1) speed improvements accomplished by the sampling strategies, (2) centralized robot coordination across Dynamic Robot Networks, (3) on-the-fly motion planning to avoid moving and previously unknown obstacles and (4) autonomous robot navigation towards individual goal locations."

	abstract = {Computational models of protein folding and ligand docking are large and complex. Few systematic methods have yet been developed to optimize the parameters in such models. We describe here an iterative parameter optimization strategy that is based on minimizing a structural error measure by descent in parameter space. At the start, we know the 'correct' native structure that we want the model to produce, and an initial set of parameters representing the relative strengths of interactions between the amino acids. The parameters are changed systematically until the model native structure converges as closely as possible to the correct native structure. As a test, we apply this parameter optimization method to the recently developed Gaussian model of protein folding: each amino acid is represented as a bead and all bonds, covalent and noncovalent, are represented by Hooke's law springs. We show that even though the Gaussian model has continuous degrees of freedom, parameters can be chosen to cause its ground state to be identical to that of Go-type lattice models, for which the global ground states are known. Parameters for a more realistic protein model can also be obtained to produce structures close to the real native structures in the protein database.},

Here we show how the long-time statistical dynamics of a simple solvated biomolecular system can be well described by a discrete-state Markov chain model constructed from trajectories that are an order of magnitude shorter than the longest relaxation times of the system. This suggests that such models, appropriately constructed from short molecular dynamics simulations, may have utility in the study of long-time conformational dynamics.},

Such studies facilitate interpretation of experimental data and allow for information not readily accessible to experimental methods to be obtained. A large part of the success of empirical force field-based methods is the quality of the force fields combined with the algorithmic advances that allow for more accurate reproduction of experimental observables. Presented is an overview of the issues associated with the development and application of empirical force fields to biomolecular systems.

	abstract={Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is a common methodology to compute pathways and thermodynamic properties of proteins. A simulation run is a series of random steps in conformation space, each perturbing some degrees of freedom of the molecule. A step is accepted with a probability that depends on the change in value of an energy function. Typical energy functions sum many terms. The most costly ones to compute are contributed by atom pairs closer than some cutoff distance. This paper introduces a new method that speeds up MCS by efficiently computing the energy at each step. The method exploits the facts that proteins are long kinematic chains and that few degrees of freedom are changed at each step. A novel data structure, called the ChainTree, captures both the kinematics and the shape of a protein at successive levels of detail. It is used to find all atom pairs contributing to the energy. It also makes it possible to identify partial energy sums left unchanged by a perturbation, thus allowing the energy value to be incrementally updated. Computational tests on four proteins of sizes ranging from 68 to 755 amino acids show that MCS with the ChainTree method is significantly faster (as much as 12 times faster for the largest protein) than with the widely used grid method. They also indicate that speed-up increases with larger proteins.},

The current path is iteratively deformed in order to get away from obstacles and satisfy the nonholonomic constraints. The core idea of the approach is to perturb the input functions of the system along the current path in order to modify this path, making an optimization criterion decrease.},

Building on similar considerations, a concept of motion coordination primitive is introduced, and used to define a motion description language for cooperative multiple-vehicle systems. Once the language is defined, algorithms for the efficient computation of feasible and optimal motion coordination plans can be implemented. The application of the proposed technique to motion planning for a group of small model helicopters is discussed, through examples on a high-fidelity simulation.},

However, it has been shown that the method performs less well in situations where the robot has to pass through a narrow passage in the scene. This is mainly due to the uniformity of the sampling used in the planner; it places many samples in large open regions and too few in tight passages. A technique based on a robot independent cell decomposition of the free workspace is proposed to guide the probabilistic sampling, such that the distribution of samples tends more toward the interesting regions in the scene. It is shown that this leads to improved performance on difficult planning problems in 2D and 3D workspaces.},

Sampling based motion planners perform approximate exploration of the configuration space in order to render the problem tractable. Each sample of configuration space as an opportunity to gain information about that configuration space. A formal definition of information gain can be used to guide a motion planner to achieve maximal progress toward the discovery of a path. We call such a motion planner entropy-guided since entropy reduction is synonymous with information gain. In the following we describe a single-query entropy-guided motion planner which uses a formal definition of information gain to focus its efforts on the acquisition of a single path from start to goal locations. Experimental evidence indicates that this approach can outperform existing single-query techniques.},

Construction of a PRM requires the ability to generate a set of random samples from the robot's configuration space, and much recent research has concentrated on new methods to do this. In this paper, we present a sampling scheme that is based on the manipulability measure associated with a robot arm. Intuitively, manipulability characterizes the arm's freedom of motion for a given configuration. Thus, our approach is to densely sample those regions of the configuration space in which manipulability is low (and therefore, the robot has less dexterity), while sampling more sparsely those regions in which the manipulability is high. We have implemented our approach, and performed extensive evaluations using prototypical problems from the path planning literature. Our results show this new sampling scheme to be effective in generating PRMs that can solve a large range of path planning problems.},

	abstract={ Research in motion planning has been striving to develop faster planning algorithms in order to be able to address a wider range of applications. In this paper a novel real-time motion planning framework, called decomposition-based motion planning, is proposed. It is particularly well suited for planning problems that arise in service and field robotics. It decomposes the original planning problem into simpler sub-problems, whose successive solution empirically results in a large reduction of the overall complexity. A particular implementation of decomposition-based planning is proposed. Experiments with an eleven degree-of-freedom mobile manipulator are presented.},

	abstract={ This paper describes a new search algorithm, the Dual Dijkstra Search. From a given initial and final configuration, Dual Dijkstra Search finds various paths which have different topologies simultaneously. This algorithm allows you to enumerate not only the optimal one but variety of meaningful candidates among local minimum paths. It is based on the algorithm of Dijkstra, which is popularly used to find an optimal solution. The method consists of two procedures: First computes local minima and ranks the paths in order of optimality. Then classify them with their topological properties and take out only the optimal paths in each groups. Computed examples include generating collision-free motion along 2D space and motion planning of 3-DOF robot. We also proposed the idea of motion compression, which simplifies the high dimensional motion planning problem. Together with this idea, we applied Dual Dijkstra Search to 7-DOF arm manipulation problem and succeeded in obtaining variety of motion candidates.},

		Reinforcement learning by direct policy gradient estimation is attractive

The algorithm satisfies the upper bounded curvature constraint and the continuous curvature requirement. In this work greater attention is placed on the computational complexity in comparison with other path-planning considerations. The rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) algorithm is used for the generation of collision free waypoints. The unnecessary waypoints are removed by a simple path pruning algorithm generating a piecewise linear path. Then a path smoothing algorithm utilizing cubic Bezier spiral curves to generate a continuous curvature path that satisfies the minimum radius of curvature constraint of UAV is implemented. The angle between two waypoints is the only information required for the generation of the continuous curvature path. The result shows that the suggested algorithm is simple and easy to implement compared with the Clothoids method.},

The device can be used as a primary or secondary aid, and consists of a portable computer, ultrasonic sensors, and stereophonic headphone. The computer applies navigation and obstacle avoidance technologies that were developed originally for mobile robots. The computer then uses a stereophonic imaging technique to process the signals from the ultrasonic sensors and relays their information to the user via stereophonic headphones. The user can interpret the information as an acoustic "picture" of the surroundings, or, depending on the operational mode, as the recommended travel direction. The acoustic signals are transmitted as discrete beeps or continuous sounds. Experimental results with the NavBelt simulator and a portable prototype show that users can travel safely in an unfamiliar and cluttered environment at speeds of up to 0.8 m/s.},

	abstract={The authors have developed a new stereo image shooting method, named the move-parallel method. There are two conventional stereo image shooting methods: the parallel-view method and the cross-eyed method. The parallel-view method allows the user to shoot and supply images that are free from geometric distortion, and thus is suitable for shooting distant views in consideration of the significant visual burden. The cross-eyed method uses the cross point to adjust the parallax of the object, but the perception of space is inevitably distorted in terms of binocular parallax. The new move-parallel method generates geometric distortion-free images by using the same shooting technique as the parallel-view method and offers easy-to-view images equivalent to those obtained with the cross-eyed method. This is achieved by moving the captured right and left images until the parallax of the object to be fixated disappears by image processing. It is important in teleoperation to capture correct information on the distance to the object to be fixated and to other objects. The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the features of the move-parallel method. This paper reports on the method, which reduces distortion of space perception in terms of binocular parallax, provides correct distance information to the observer, and reduces the visual burden of viewing stereo images.},

Generally, the operating function of manipulators requires the highest performance such as minimum time, minimum energy, and no damage to the system. This paper proposes a minimum time trajectory planning that is clamped with cubic splines and uses Harmony Search (HS) algorithm for solving the optimization problem. Minimum time is chosen to be the objective function as time is critical for productivities in the industrial. However, kinematics constraints such as velocities, accelerations and jerks limitation are still considered. In this work, the simulation of the 6-DOFs robot manipulator trajectory is employed to determine the minimum time trajectory planning. The best solution from two techniques, the HS and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP), are compared. The results show that the HS method obtains the optimal interval time better than the SQP method and it does not require finding the initial interval time value for the optimization process. This reduces the complication and time consuming of the optimization process.},

The experimental results suggest that the improvement of the data association leads to more robust and faster methods in the presence of wrong correspondences.},

	abstract={ An evolutionary algorithm based framework, a combination of modified breeder genetic algorithms incorporating characteristics of classic genetic algorithms, is utilized to design an offline/online path planner for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) autonomous navigation. The path planner calculates a curved path line with desired characteristics in a three-dimensional (3-D) rough terrain environment, represented using B-spline curves, with the coordinates of its control points being the evolutionary algorithm artificial chromosome genes. Given a 3-D rough environment and assuming flight envelope restrictions, two problems are solved: i) UAV navigation using an offline planner in a known environment, and, ii) UAV navigation using an online planner in a completely unknown environment. The offline planner produces a single B-Spline curve that connects the starting and target points with a predefined initial direction. The online planner, based on the offline one, is given on-board radar readings which gradually produces a smooth 3-D trajectory aiming at reaching a predetermined target in an unknown environment; the produced trajectory consists of smaller B-spline curves smoothly connected with each other. Both planners have been tested under different scenarios, and they have been proven effective in guiding an UAV to its final destination, providing near-optimal curved paths quickly and efficiently.},

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be used under these disasters for surveillance, search and rescue. In order to have good performances in mission areas, effective algorithms are required in mission re-tasking and path re-planning to handle unanticipated events or any environmental disturbances. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to deal with path re-planning for multi-mission of multi-UAV under environments with unexpected events. A group of UAVs are considered to perform joint missions. Each UAV plans its own initial, optimal or sub-optimal path using Voronoi graph and Dijkstra algorithm. Our algorithm is then employed to assign a distinct task to each UAV and to re-plan its path based on new multi-mission requirement corresponding to some unexpected events. In addition to a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, the paper has also provided relevant simulation results which have shown that the algorithm can be used effectively for multiple cooperating UAVs??? path re-planning under uncertain and dynamic disaster environments.},

Four rotors are devoted to the stabilization of the orientation of the helicopter, and the other four are used to drive the lateral displacements. A precompensation on the roll and pitch angles has been introduced so that the attitude dynamics is practically independent of the translational dynamics. This compensation is directly related to the velocity of the lateral motors. The dynamical model is obtained using the Euler-Lagrange approach. The proposed configuration is particularly useful for image processing since the the camera orientation is held constant. The eight-rotor rotorcraft is simpler to pilot than other rotorcrafts. A control strategy is proposed that uses the optical flow measurements to achieve a hover flight that is robust with respect to perturbations like wind. The new aerial configuration and control strategy have been tested in real-time experiments.},

The probabilistic threat exposure map (PTEM) is used as the mathematical formulation of the area of operation for the guidance strategy to make intelligent decisions based on a set of defined rules. The rules are developed for three objectives in the order of priority as: 1) avoid obstacles/restricted regions; 2) maintain the target proximity; 3) minimize UAV threat exposure level. A least-square estimation and kinematic relations are used to estimate/predict the target states based on noisy position measurements. The work presented herein addresses the same problem as in a previous work by the authors, and aims at improving the computational efficiency without compromising the performance. Simulation results of several pursuit scenarios demonstrate the full capabilities of the strategy and the improvement over the previous work},

Control of the position and orientation dynamics is decoupled using a visual error based on spherical centroid data, along with estimations of the linear velocity and the gravitational inertial direction extracted from image features and an embedded inertial measurement unit. The visual error used compensates for poor conditioning of the image Jacobian matrix by introducing a nonhomogeneous gain term adapted to the visual sensitivity of the error measurements. A nonlinear controller, that ensures exponential convergence of the system considered, is derived for the full dynamics of the system using control Lyapunov function design techniques.

	abstract={A modular system architecture has been developed to support visual navigation by an autonomous land vehicle. The system consists of vision modules performing image processing, three-dimensional shape recovery, and geometric reasoning, as well as modules for planning, navigating, and piloting. The system runs in two distinct modes, bootstrap and feedforward. The bootstrap mode requires analysis of entire images to find and model the objects of interest in the scene (e.g., roads). In the feedforward mode (while the vehicle is moving), attention is focused on small parts of the visual field as determined by prior views of the scene, to continue to track and model the objects of interest. General navigational tasks are decomposed into three categories, all of which contribute to planning a vehicle path. They are called long-, intermediate-, and short-range navigation, reflecting the scale to which they apply. The system has been implemented as a set of concurrent communicating modules and used to drive a camera (carried by a robot arm) over a scale model road network on a terrain board. A large subset of the system has been reimplemented on a VICOM image processor and has driven the DARPA Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALV) at Martin Marietta's test site in Denver, CO.},

The approach is based on the use of a pattern recognition scheme, the quadratic classifier, to find collision-free paths in unknown indoor corridor environments. Obstacles treated in this study include the walls of the corridor and the objects that appear in the way of ALV navigation in the corridor. Detected obstacles as well as the two sides of the ALV body are considered as patterns. A systematic method for separating these patterns into two classes is proposed. The two pattern classes are used as the input data to design a quadratic classifier. Finally, the two-dimensional decision boundary of the classifier, which goes through the middle point between the two front vehicle wheels, is taken as a local collision-free path. This approach is implemented on a real ALV and successful navigations confirm the feasibility of the approach},

Such a system will also provide greater functionality in unstructured terrain to unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper describes an algorithm for landing hazard avoidance based on images from a single moving camera. The core of the algorithm is an efficient application of structure from motion to generate a dense elevation map of the landing area. Hazards are then detected in this map and a safe landing site is selected. The algorithm has been implemented on an autonomous helicopter testbed and demonstrated four times resulting in the first autonomous landing of an unmanned helicopter in unknown and hazardous terrain. },

The mission of the UAV is low altitude navigation from an initial position to a final position in a partially known 3-D environment while avoiding obstacles and minimizing path length. We use a hierarchical approach to path planning. We distinguish between a global offline computation, based on a coarse known model of the environment and a local online computation, based on the information coming from the vision system. A UAV builds and updates a virtual 3-D model of the surrounding environment by processing image sequences and fusing them with sensor data. Based on such a model the UAV will plan a path from its current position to the terminal point. It will then follow such path, getting more data from the on-board cameras, and refining map and local path in real time.},

The system encompasses task generation and allocation, flight path generation and tracking, and synchronization between cooperative tasks. Task allocation is posed as a constraint satisfaction problem. The design of two classes of orbital flight paths, lateral and longitudinal, is discussed.

MultiUAV has been used to simulate a cooperative moving target engagement (CMTE) scenario, with a team of UAVs acting as a sensor and communication network to cooperatively track and attack moving ground targets. This scenario illustrates the utility of MultiUAV for cooperative control applications requiring heterogeneous vehicles with varied sensor, communication, dynamic, and weapon capabilities. A human supervisor designates one or more moving ground targets for the vehicles to attack. The vehicle agents must then autonomously and cooperatively determine which vehicles perform the required tasks, when the tasks are performed, and what flight paths are used. This requires assigning time-dependent cooperative and joint tasks, where multiple sub-elements of the primary task must be accomplished by different vehicles, for any of the tasks to have value. This paper focuses on the unique requirements of the CMTE scenario and how they are addressed in the MultiUAV simulation.},

Developments in spacecraft path-planning have shown that trajectory optimization including collision avoidance can be written as a linear program subject to mixed integer constraints, known as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This can be solved using commercial software written for the operations research community. In the paper, an approximate model of aircraft dynamics using only linear constraints is developed, enabling the MILP approach to be applied to aircraft collision avoidance. The formulation can also be extended to include multiple waypoint path-planning, in which each vehicle is required to visit a set of points in an order chosen within the optimization.},

	abstract={ In recent years, advancements in three technology areas, microelectronics, MEMS sensors, and GPS receivers, have allowed small UAVs to overcome critical deficiencies and become practical for insertion into the military mainstream. The maturation and commercialization of these technologies have resulted in readily available components that have decreased in both size and cost, to the point where truly low-cost, highly capable, small UAVs are possible. In particular, inertial devices such as MEMS accelerometers and angular rate sensors, pressure sensors, and magnetometers have reached the point where they are reliable, accurate, and affordable. These devices allow the determination of vehicle state with the precision required to enable autonomous flight. In addition, advanced microelectronic devices, such as digital signal processors, field programmable gate arrays, and microcontrollers have enabled sophisticated flight control functions, including fully autonomous flight using GPS waypoints. In combination, these advances have allowed small UAVs such as Pointer, Raven, and Dragon Eye to move into full-scale production and continue to allow the progression of UAVs into smaller and smaller packages. To address several of the deployment issues connected with small UAVs, a gun-launched version, along with the underpinning technologies, is under development. This device represents a clear departure from conventional UAVs with several clear advantages; however, it also contains severe design challenges, as well as test and evaluation dilemmas. An option of this type is envisioned not as a replacement for conventional small UAVs but rather as an augmenting capability.},

The framework has been verified through simulation and in actual flight. Empirical results show that these techniques used with such a framework offer a surprisingly efficient method for dynamically reconfiguring a motion plan based on unforeseen contingencies which may arise during the execution of a plan.

Then, this centralized online optimization problem is partitioned into several UAV subsystems optimization problems and solved in a parallel manner using a Nash optimality based decentralized RH optimization method, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for subsystem optimization. Next, by introducing the heuristic information and improving the extension of node, a modified rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) based path planning algorithm is presented to the UAV search path planning.

We present a fast and exact planner for our mobile robot model, based upon recursive subdivision of a collision-free path generated by a lower-level geometric planner that ignores the motion constraints. The resultant trajectory is optimized to give a path that is of near-minimal length in its homotopy class. Our claims of high speed are supported by experimental results for implementations that assume a robot moving amid polygonal obstacles. The completeness and the complexity of the algorithm are proven using an appropriate metric in the configuration space R2×S1 of the robot. This metric is defined by using the length of the shortest paths in the absence of obstacles as the distance between two configurations. We prove that the new induced topology and the classical one are the same. Although we concentrate upon the car-like robot, the generalization of these techniques leads to new theoretical issues involving sub-Riemannian geometry and to practical results for nonholonomic motion planning},

	abstract={ Sampling based planners have become increasingly efficient in solving the problems of classical motion planning and its applications. In particular, techniques based on the rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) have generated highly successful single-query planners. Recently, a variant of this planner called dynamic-domain RRT was introduced by Yershova et al. (2005). It relies on a new sampling scheme that improves the performance of the RRT approach on many motion planning problems. One of the drawbacks of this method is that it introduces a new parameter that requires careful tuning. In this paper we analyze the influence of this parameter and propose a new variant of the dynamic-domain RRT, which iteratively adapts the sampling domain for the Voronoi region of each node during the search process. This allows automatic tuning of the parameter and significantly increases the robustness of the algorithm. The resulting variant of the algorithm has been tested on several path planning problems.},

An RBF-network is trained to recognise the distance of an obstacle primitive and to respond with the associated pattern. The interpolating features of radial basis functions are exploited to achieve a good approximation for untrained patterns. The main principles of the method are explained for a two-link manipulator.

Similar to prior kinodynamic planning methods, the sampled nodes in our roadmaps are generated based on dynamic simulation. Moreover, we bias these samples by using constraint forces designed to avoid collisions while moving toward the goal configuration. We adaptively reduce the complexity of the state space by determining a subset of joints that contribute most towards the motion and only simulate these joints. Based on these configurations, we compute a valid path that satisfies non-penetration, kinematic, and dynamics constraints. Our approach can be easily combined with a variety of motion planning algorithms including probabilistic roadmaps (PRMs) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) and applied to articulated robots with hundreds of joints. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several challenging benchmarks},

	abstract={ Mobile robots often must find a trajectory to another position in their environment, subject to constraints. This is the problem of planning a path through a continuous domain Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are a recently developed representation on which fast continuous domain path planners can be based. In this work, we build a path planning system based on RRTs that interleaves planning and execution, first evaluating it in simulation and then applying it to physical robots. Our planning algorithm, ERRT (execution extended RRT), introduces two novel extensions of previous RRT work, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve replanning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT is successfully applied to a real-time multi-robot system. Results demonstrate that ERRT is significantly more efficient for replanning than a basic RRT planner, performing competitively with or better than existing heuristic and reactive real-time path planning approaches. ERRT is a significant step forward with the potential for making path planning common on real robots, even in challenging continuous, highly dynamic domains.},

    abstract={ To efficiently solve challenges related to motion-planning problems with dynamics, this paper proposes treating motion planning not just as a search problem in a continuous space but as a search problem in a hybrid space consisting of discrete and continuous components. A multilayered framework is presented which combines discrete search and sampling-based motion planning. This framework is called synergistic combination of layers of planning ( ${{{tt SyCLoP}}}$) hereafter. Discrete search uses a workspace decomposition to compute leads, i.e., sequences of regions in the neighborhood that guide sampling-based motion planning during the state-space exploration. In return, information gathered by motion planning, such as progress made, is fed back to the discrete search. This combination allows ${{{tt SyCLoP}}}$ to identify new directions to lead the exploration toward the goal, making it possible to efficiently find solutions, even when other planners get stuck. Simulation experiments with dynamical models of ground and flying vehicles demonstrate that the combination of discrete search and motion planning in ${{{tt SyCLoP}}}$ offers significant advantages. In fact, speedups of up to two orders of magnitude were obtained for all the sampling-based motion planners used as the continuous layer of ${{{tt SyCLoP}}}$. },

Even though the time-parameterization problem is well known in robotics, the application to humanoid robots has not been addressed. This is because of the complexity of the kinematical structure as well as the dynamical motion equation. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the time parameterization of a statically stable path to be transformed into a dynamically stable trajectory within the humanoid-robot capacities can be expressed as an optimization problem. Furthermore, we propose an efficient method to solve the obtained optimization problem. The proposed method has been successfully validated on the humanoid robot HRP-2 by conducting several experiments. These results have revealed the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method. },

A collision-free path connecting a start and a goal point provides information on the division of the space. In the case of 2D path planning, for example, the path divides the space into two regions. This suggests a dual problem of first dividing the whole space into such two regions and then picking up the boundary as a path. We develop a method of solving this dual problem using support vector machine (SVM). SVM generates a nonlinear separating surface based on the margin maximization principle. This property is suitable for the purpose of usual path planning problems, that is, generating a safe and smooth path. The details of the path planning methods in 2D and 3D spaces are described with several planning results. Future possibilities of combining the proposed concept with other path planning methodologies are also discussed},

	abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (\&ap;150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds)},

        This paper presents a method to determine if a usable wheelchair accessible route in a facility exists using motion-planning techniques. We use a [`]performance-based' approach to predict the performance of a facility design against requirements of a building code. This approach has advantages over the traditional [`]prescriptive' code-based approach for assessing acceptability of designs, which is normal practice today for assessing wheelchair accessibility. The prescriptive method can be ambiguous, contradictory, complex, and unduly restrictive in practice, and it can be ad hoc and difficult to implement as a computer application. The performance-based approach directly models the actual possible behaviors of an artifact (in this case, wheelchair motion) that are related to the functional intent of the designed system (a building) and (hopefully) to the specification of a prescriptive building code. This paper presents example cases from architectural practice to illustrate the use of robot motion-planning techniques for wheelchair accessibility analysis. This application is an example of using modern computational methods in support of knowledge-intensive engineering. The simulation method has broad applicability within engineering design. We illustrate and discuss how to analyze virtual simulations of the detailed behavior of a designed artifact in order to assess its use by intended users.",

Rotations are represented as a certain 3-dimensional subset of the space of quaternions. This representation gives rise to algebraic constraints on the allowable configurations of the moving object. We define a generalized Voronoi diagram in the configuration space and show that a subset of the diagram, consisting of zero and one dimensional manifolds, can be constructed in polynomial time, and paths found along it. While this subset of the diagram is not always sufficient for path planning, the triangulation of 1- dimensional manifolds can be used as the basis of a complete path planning algorithm by adding other 1-manifolds.},

The SANDROS planner is resolution complete, and its computation time is commensurate with the problem difficulty measured empirically by the solution-path complexity. For many realistic problems involving a manipulator or a rigid object with six degrees of freedom, its computation times are under 1 minute for easy problems involving wide free space, and several minutes for relatively hard problems},

The fast path-optimization process is interruptable at any time, thus always getting the best result obtainable within a certain amount of time. This property is especially useful in interactive or autonomous applications where the computation time is much more important than the traverse time and the quality of the robot motion. Some example environments including obstacle-constraint tightness and a bulky payload show the performance and usefulness of the new algorithm},

    abstract={We address robust path planning for a mobile agent in a general environment by finding minimum cost source-destination paths having prescribed widths. The main result is a new approach that optimally solves the robust path planning problem using an efficient network flow formulation. Our algorithm represents a significant departure from conventional shortest-path or graph search based methods; it not only handles environments with solid polygonal obstacles, but also generalizes to arbitrary cost maps that may arise in modeling incomplete or uncertain knowledge of the environment. Simple extensions allow us to address higher dimensional problem instances and minimum-surface computations; the latter is a result of independent interest.

	abstract={We present new techniques for establishing lower bounds in robot motion planning problems. Our scheme is based on path encoding and uses homotopy equivalence classes of paths to encode state. We first apply the method to the shortest path problem in 3 dimensions. The problem is to find the shortest path under an Lp metric (e.g. a euclidean metric) between two points amid polyhedral obstacles. Although this problem has been extensively studied, there were no previously known lower bounds. We show that there may be exponentially many shortest path classes in single-source multiple-destination problems, and that the single-source single-destination problem is NP-hard. We use a similar proof technique to show that two dimensional dynamic motion planning with bounded velocity is NP-hard. Finally we extend the technique to compliant motion planning with uncertainty in control. Specifically, we consider a point in 3 dimensions which is commanded to move in a straight line, but whose actual motion may differ from the commanded motion, possibly involving sliding against obstacles. Given that the point initially lies in some start region, the problem of finding a sequence of commanded velocities which is guaranteed to move the point to the goal is shown to be non-deterministic exponential time hard, making it the first provably intractable problem in robotics.},

	abstract={ During the last few years, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees, RRTs, has been recognized as a very useful tool for designing efficient single-shot path planners. Another benefit is that RRTs can easily handle planning problems involving non-holonomic systems. However, it has also been noted that the narrow passage problem can become even more severe compared to other randomized methods. To reduce that problem, we suggest augmenting RRT-planners with local trees. Furthermore, using local trees, the planner is able to explore several difficult regions in parallel, something that has proved to be very effective for problems where the solution trajectory repeatedly has to pass difficult regions. We present powerful heuristics for when to create such trees and how often they should be allowed to grow, such that the RRT-planner will improve its qualities as an efficient single-shot path planner. The resulting algorithm, RRTLocTrees, is implemented in a newly developed object-oriented framework for path planning and tested on four different path planning problems, with excellent results.},

Given a polyhedral description of robot, load and environment the algorithm first computes (off-line) a graph which roughly represents the skeleton of the freespace. Due to the way of its computation this graph does not preserve connectivity, although the freespace is a connected set, which is assumed throughout this paper. Reflecting randomly at C-space obstacles a connection between subgraphs is generated. In a second step (online) a connection between a start and a goal configuration to the graph is searched for. The impact of this algorithm concerning movable obstacles is discussed. This method is general and four examples are presented to demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to different kinematic structures with 3, 6 and 12 degrees of freedom},

Our iterative strategy adaptively selects a planner whose strengths match the current situation, and then, online, switches to a different planner when circumstances change. This requires techniques to evaluate the characteristics of the current query, and a set of planners which are characterized so that we can match the query with the best planner for it.

It is a sampling-based method which builds a tree and takes a substantially different approach from other exploration planners such as RRT [18] and EST [12]. PDST-EXPLORE is a general purpose planner but is designed to overcome difficulties inherent in planning for robots with non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, our planner represents samples as path segments rather than individual states and uses non-uniform subdivisions of the state space to estimate coverage. This change avoids many of the problems that previous sampling-based planners have had with milestone placement, metrics and coverage estimation. We use a deterministic update schedule together with randomized path generation to adaptively strike a balance between greedy exploration and methodical search. We have obtained a proof of probabilistic completeness for the planner which assumes very little about the specific robot system that the planner operates on. Finally, we have implemented the planner for planar kinodynamic point robots, differential drive robots and blimp-like robots. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the planner{\textquoteright}s implementation as well as its robustness in covering the entire reachable free space.

                 navigation in indoor cluttered environments. A new
                 algorithm for both longitudinal and lateral real-time
                 control of wheel-based mobile robots has been proposed.
                 Its main characteristic is smooth and stable following of
                 the on-line replanned path. Our control method is
                 actually extension of the virtual vehicle method proposed
                 by M. Egerstedt et al., which is based on the
                 introduction of a look-ahead point on the path that
                 serves as reference point for the control algorithm.
                 While the original virtual vehicle method uses only error
                 feedback for reference point movement along the path, our
                 method uses also a feedforward component based on path
                 curve characteristics between the robot and the reference
                 point. In this way stable robot movement is achieved also
                 in the presence of obstacles that are critical with
                 respect to the path following error. Experimental
                 verification is provided for a differential drive robot

	abstract={The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm can be applied to the robotic path planning problem and performs well in challenging, dynamic domains. Traditional RRT methods use a binary cost function and they select portions of the tree for expansion based on the Euclidean distance to the target. However, in outdoor navigation, the relative cost of terrain can also provide useful input to a planning algorithm that traditional RRT methods cannot take advantage of. We present the Metric Adaptive RRT (MA-RRT), which integrates planning and fast execution for generating paths over a cost map. The MA-RRT algorithm considers underlying cost of a path when calculating the distance function for tree expansion. A heuristic value is also used for determining distance from a point to the target and an adaptive mechanism is employed for adjusting the heuristic on-line. We have implemented our approach in offline simulations and in outdoor robot experiments, and show that the MA-RRT algorithm can improve upon the quality of the path returned when cost is considered. The trade off between cost consideration and runtime performance is also presented.},

    abstract={Current motion planners, in general, can neither "see" the world around them, nor learn from experience. That is, their reliance on collision tests as the only means of sensing the environment yields a tactile, myopic perception of the world. Such short-sightedness greatly limits any potential for detection, learning, or reasoning about frequently encountered situations. As a result, it is common for current planners to solve and re-solve the same general scenarios over and over, each time none the wiser. We thus propose a general approach for motion planning, as well as a specific illustrative algorithm, in which local sensory information, in conjunction with prior accumulated experience, are exploited to improve planner performance. Our approach relies on learning viability models for the agent's "perceptual space", and the use thereof to direct planning effort. Experiments with three test agents show significant speedups and skill-transfer between environments.},

The paths returned by the algorithm fulfill and optimize multiple criteria that 1) are calculated based on the properties of real UAVs, terrains, radars, and missiles and 2) are structured in different levels of priority according to the selected mission. The paths of all the UAVs are obtained with the multiple coordinated agents coevolution EA (MCACEA), which is a general framework that uses an EA per agent (i.e., UAV) that share their optimal solutions to coordinate the evolutions of the EAs populations using cooperation objectives. This planner works offline and online by means of recalculating parts of the original path to avoid unexpected risks while the UAV is flying. Its search space and computation time have been reduced using some special operators in the EAs. The successful results of the paths obtained in multiple scenarios, which are statistically analyzed in the paper, and tested against a simulator that incorporates complex models of the UAVs, radars, and missiles, make us believe that this planner could be used for real-flight missions.},

We further show that a transformation from chained form to path coordinates allows the resulting lattice to be bent along any C1 continuous path. We exploit this fact by shaping it along the skeleton of arbitrary structured environments, such as the center of road lanes and corridors. In our experiments in both structured (i.e. on-road) and unstructured (i.e. parking lot) scenarios, we successfully demonstrate for the first time the applicability of lattice-based planning approaches to search queries in arbitrary environments.},

Whereas in non-urban domains such as deserts the problem of successful GPS-based navigation appears to be almost solved, navigation in urban domains particularly in the close vicinity of buildings is still a challenging problem. In such situations GPS accuracy significantly drops down due to multiple signal reflections with larger objects causing the so-called multipath error. In this paper we contribute a novel approach for incorporating multipath errors into the conventional GPS sensor model by analyzing environmental structures from online generated point clouds. The approach has been validated by experimental results conducted with an all-terrain robot operating in scenarios requiring close-to-building navigation. Presented results show that positioning accuracy can significantly be improved within urban domains.},

However, the performance of such tree-based planners that rely on uniform sampling strategy degrades significantly when narrow passages are contained in the configuration space. Given the assumption that computation resources should be allocated in proportion the geometric complexity of local region, we present a novel single-query Multi-RRTs path planning framework that employs an improved Bridge Test algorithm to identify global important roadmaps in narrow passages. Multiple trees can grown from these sampled roadmaps to explore sub-regions which are difficult to reach. The probability of selecting one particular tree for expansion and connection, which can dynamically updated by on-line learning algorithm based on the historic results of exploration, guides the tree through narrow passage rapidly. Experimental results show that the proposed approach gives substantial improvement in planning efficiency over a wide range of single-query path planning problems.},

abstract={Planning collision-free paths for multiple robots traversing a shared space is a problem that grows combinatorially with the number of robots. The naive centralised approach soon becomes intractable for even a moderate number of robots. Decentralised approaches, such as prioritised planning, are much faster but lack completeness. Previous work has demonstrated that the search can be significantly reduced by adding a level of abstraction. We first partition the map into subgraphs of particular known structure, such as cliques and halls, and then build abstract plans which describe the transitions of robots between the subgraphs. These plans are constrained by the structural properties of the subgraphs used. When an abstract plan is found, it can easily be resolved into a complete concrete plan without further search. In this paper, we show how this method of planning can be implemented as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Constraint propagation and intelligent search ordering further reduce the size of the search problem, allowing us to solve large problems significantly more quickly. Empirical evaluation on a realistic planning problem shows the clear superiority of the constraint-based approach, but the value of abstraction is mixed: it allows us to solve more problems at the cost of a time-overhead on simple problems. This implementation also opens up opportunities for the application of a number of other search reduction and optimisation techniques, as we will discuss.},

However, this is a challenging problem because of the difficulty of imposing the motion of the target point by a finite number actuation points located at the boundary of the deformable object. In this paper, an approach towards positioning operation of an internal target point of a deformable object to the desired location by a system of three actuators is presented. First, we design an optimization technique that minimizes the total force applied to the object to determine the location of actuation points to effect the desired motion. Then a position-based PI controller is developed to control the motion of the actuators. A passivity observer and a passivity controller are developed to guarantee the stability of the whole system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Since environments and their characters are growing more realistic, a character's path needs to be visually convincing, meaning that the path is smooth, short, has some clearance to the obstacles in the environment, and avoids other characters. Up to now, it has proved difficult to meet these criteria simultaneously and in real-time. We introduce a new data structure, i.e. the Explicit Corridor Map, which allows creating the shortest path, the path that has the largest amount of clearance, or any path in between. Besides being efficient, the corresponding algorithms are surprisingly simple. By integrating the data structure and algorithms into the Indicative Route Method, we show that visually convincing short paths can be obtained in real-time.},

Accordingly it requires a model of the future evolution of the environment. In the real-world, the future trajectories of the obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available.

For this reason, treating resting contacts with impulses instead of forces has become common, but this approach also suffers from a significant problem: applying impulses at the time-of-contact can keep the simulation from advancing. This scenario is analogous to one of the paradoxes devised by the philosopher Zeno, and has been referred to as a Zeno point in the simulation community. I describe how to avoid Zeno points without violating the theoretical dynamic behavior of the simulated bodies and without permitting interpenetration. Two experiments demonstrate that the method works as desired where alternative approaches that required accepting interpenetration or longer running times were previously required.},

This paper is an extension of that work, proposing control laws that are computed in a distributed way while still ensuring collision-free formation reconfigurations. Furthermore, we consider an extension of the group rendezvous problem. The agents are required to meet at the rendezvous point and establish consensus on formation state. Again, the grid abstraction is used to describe the formation state. Nonholonomic constraints of agent motion are taken into account explicitly. As our approach is communication-based, we also examine the effects of temporary communication loss.},

abstract={A novel artificial-potential function approach is presented for planning the paths of distributed sensor networks in a complex dynamic environment. The approach implements a novel potential function generated from a probability density function (PDF) parameterized by an adaptive Gaussian mixture that is optimized to meet network-level objectives, such as cooperative track detection. The PDF represents the goal density that would be obtained by sampling a statistically-significant number of sensors from the mixture. However, since a smaller number of sensors may be deployed, and each sensor is represented by a disk, the potential function is generated by multiplying the PDF by a likelihood update model that produces networks with disjoint fields-of-view. The approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving ocean sensor networks deployed in a region of interest near the New Jersey coast.},

    abstract={Optimal heuristic searches such as A* search are commonly used for low-dimensional planning such as 2D path finding. These algorithms however, typically do not scale well to high-dimensional planning problems such as motion planning for robotic arms, computing motion trajectories for non-holonomic robotic vehicles and motion synthesis for humanoid characters. A recently developed randomized version of A* search, called R* search, scales to higher-dimensional planning problems by trading off deterministic optimality guarantees of A* for probabilistic sub-optimality guarantees. In this paper, we show that in addition to its scalability, R* lends itself well to a parallel implementation. In particular, we demonstrate how R* can be implemented on the GPU. On the theoretical side, the GPU version of R*, called R*GPU, preserves all the theoretical properties of R* including its probabilistic bounds on sub-optimality. On the experimental side, we show that R*GPU consistently produces lower cost solutions, scales better in terms of memory, and runs faster than R*. These results hold for both motion planning for a 6DOF robot arm planar as well as 2D path finding.},

    abstract={An efficient planning algorithm for the hexagonal metamorphic self-reconfiguring system (SRS) is presented. Empirically, the algorithm achieves an time complexity of O(n) averaged over random problem instances. The planning algorithm is capable of solving approximately 97% of planning tasks in the general state space of configurations containing less than 20,000 units. The state space is divided into two classes according to planning efficiency. The configurations belonging to the first class permit an Euler tour to be wrapped around the robotic aggregate. The existence of the Euler tour implies units are free to move around the perimeter of the SRS. Planning between configurations in this class can be performed in O(n) using a specialized planning algorithm. The set of Euler tour configurations span a large volume of the general state space of the hexagonal SRS. A second specialized planning algorithm plans from a general configuration to a nearby Euler tour configuration. While planning in the general configuration state space is computationally harder, the distance required to plan is short. Thus, the combination of both algorithms allows us to efficiently plan for a large proportion of possible reconfiguration tasks for the hexagonal metamorphic robot.},

The GMM models the likelihood of configurations given time. The planner is based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree search with the search tree kept within the statistical model. Collision avoidance is included by not allowing the tree to grow into obstacles. The system is designed to act as a backup for a faster reactive planner that may fall into a local minimum.

Drawing from AI, SMAP uses symbolic action planning to identify actions and regions of the continuous space that sampling-based motion planning can further explore to significantly advance the search.

Toward practical implementation of these results for path planning in unstructured environments, we develop a receding-horizon formulation in which path planning for moving and static obstacles is addressed locally, while path planning for static obstacles is addressed globally. This formulation reduces the overall computational burden of path planning and makes it suitable for very large domains. The result is a suboptimal receding horizon planner and a matching condition that connects local planning with global planning.

First, we formulate a relaxation of the path planning problem using polygonal approximations. We show that path planning problem for multiple robots under various constraints and missions, such as curvature and obstacle avoidance constraints as well as rendezvous and maximal total area coverage, can be cast as a nonconvex optimization problem. Then, we propose an alternative dual formulation that results in no duality gap. We show that the alternative dual function can be interpreted as minimum potential energy of a multi-particle system with discontinuous spring-like forces. Finally, we show that using the proposed duality-based framework, an approximation of the minimal length path planning problem (also known as Dubins' problem) in presence of obstacles can be solved efficiently using primal-dual interior-point methods.},

We present results for 2D image sequences consisting of single ambiguous, visible or occluded balls, as well as results for 3D computer-generated sequences of objects in free-flight with added noise. Results suggest that restricting the estimation to allow only motions that are feasible according to the physics simulator can produce marked improvement when the observed object motion is within the limits of the physics simulator and its world model. Conversely, merely penalising deviations from feasible physical dynamics produces a consistent but incremental improvement over more common dynamics models.},

Then, a new rule-based prioritization scheme is applied in two phases: (a) Path Prioritization, which determines which robot can directly move along its shortest path and which robot should deviate from it, and (b) Motion Prioritization, which decides the order of robots' sequential moves. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for minimizing the number of moves by adding extra vertices to the tree.},

In practice, these algorithms perform very well on configuration space planning, but struggle to grow efficiently in systems with dynamics or differential constraints. This is due in part to the fact that the conventional distance metric, Euclidean distance, does not take into account system dynamics and constraints when identifying which node in the existing tree is capable of producing children closest to a given point in state space. We show that an affine quadratic regulator (AQR) design can be used to approximate the exact minimum-time distance pseudometric at a reasonable computational cost. We demonstrate improved exploration of the state spaces of the double integrator and simple pendulum when using this pseudometric within the RRT framework, but this improvement drops off as systems' nonlinearity and complexity increase.

In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based manipulation planner that does deal effectively with the high-dimensionality of the problem. The planner achieves the required efficiency due to the following three factors: (a) its use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics; (b) its use of basic (small) motion primitives as atomic actions; and (c) its use of ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality. Our experimental analysis on a real mobile manipulation platform with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator shows the ability of the planner to solve manipulation in cluttered spaces by generating consistent, low-cost motion trajectories while providing guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality.},

Over 181GB of image and inertial data are captured using head-mounted stereo cameras. This data is processed into a relative map covering 121 km of Southern England. We point out the numerous challenges we encounter, and highlight in particular the problem of undetected ego-motion, which occurs when the robot finds itself on-or-within a moving frame of reference. In contrast to global-frame representations, we find that the continuous relative representation naturally accommodates moving-reference-frames - without having to identify them first, and without inconsistency. Within a moving-reference-frame, and without drift-less global exteroceptive sensing, motion with respect to the global-frame is effectively unobservable. This underlying truth drives us towards relative topometric solutions like relative bundle adjustment (RBA), which has no problem representing distance and metric Euclidean structure, yet does not suffer inconsistency introduced by the attempt to solve in the global-frame.},

abstract={This paper presents a geometry-based, multi-layered synergistic approach to solve motion planning problems for mobile robots involving temporal goals. The temporal goals are described over subsets of the workspace (called propositions) using temporal logic. A multi-layered synergistic framework has been proposed recently for solving planning problems involving significant discrete structure. In this framework, a high-level planner uses a discrete abstraction of the system and the exploration information to suggest feasible high-level plans. A low-level sampling-based planner uses the physical model of the system, and the suggested high-level plans, to explore the state-space for feasible solutions. In this paper, we advocate the use of geometry within the above framework to solve motion planning problems involving temporal goals. We present a technique to construct the discrete abstraction using the geometry of the obstacles and the propositions defined over the workspace. Furthermore, we show through experiments that the use of geometry results in significant computational speedups compared to previous work. Traces corresponding to trajectories of the system are defined employing the sampling interval used by the low-level algorithm. The applicability of the approach is shown for second-order nonlinear robot models in challenging workspace environments with obstacles, and for a variety of temporal logic specifications.},

    abstract={Sampling-based kinodynamic planners, such as the popular RRT algorithm, have been proposed as promising solutions to planning for systems with dynamics. Nevertheless, complex systems often raise significant challenges. In particular, the state-space exploration of sampling-based tree planners can be heavily biased towards a specific direction due to the presence of dynamics and underactuation. The premise of this paper is that it is possible to use statistical tools to learn quickly the effects of the constraints in the algorithm's state-space exploration during a training session. Then during the online operation of the algorithm, this information can be utilized so as to counter the undesirable bias due to the dynamics by appropriately adapting the control propagation step. The resulting method achieves a more balanced exploration of the state-space, resulting in faster solutions to planning challenges. The paper provides proof of concept experiments comparing against and improving upon the standard RRT using MATLAB simulations for (a) swinging up different versions of a 3-link Acrobot system with dynamics and (b) a second-order car-like system with significant drift.},

The principle of the method is to use online the results of a probabilistic planner to describe the free space in which the planning takes place, by computing a principal component analysis (PCA). This method identifies the locally free directions of the free space. Given that description, our algorithm accelerates the progression along these favored directions. In this way, if the free space appears as a small volume around a sub-manifold of a high-dimensional configuration space, the method overcomes the usual limitations of probabilistic motion planning algorithms and finds a solution quickly. The presented method is theoretically analyzed and experimentally compared with known motion planners.},

RANSAM exploits the theory of the birthday attack whose mathematical background is known from cryptography. The RANSAM technique can be applied to various fields of application such as mobile robotics, computer vision, and medical robotics. Since standard computers feature multi-core processors nowadays, a considerable speedup can be obtained by distributing selected subtasks of RANSAM among the available cores. First of all this paper addresses the parallelization of the RANSAM approach. Several important characteristics are derived from a probabilistic point of view. Moreover, we apply a fuzzy criterion to compute the matching quality, which is an important step towards real-time capability. The algorithm has been implemented for Windows and for the QNX RTOS. In an experimental section the performance of both implementations is compared and our theoretical results are validated.},

abstract={This paper presents a new on-line planner for dynamic environments that is based on the concept of velocity obstacles (VO). It addresses the issue of motion safety, i.e. avoiding states of inevitable collision, by selecting a proper time horizon for the velocity obstacle. The proper choice of the time horizon ensures that the boundary of the velocity obstacle coincides with the boundary of the set of inevitable collision states. This time horizon is determined by the minimum time it would take the robot to avoid collision, either by stopping or by passing the respective obstacle. The planner generates a near-time optimal trajectory to the goal by selecting at each time step the velocity that minimizes the time-to-go and is out of the velocity obstacle. The planner takes into account the shape, velocity, and path curvature of the obstacle's trajectory. It is demonstrated for on-line motion planning in very crowded static and dynamic environments.},

Our approach produces smooth, complex maneuvers over large distances through the use of an anytime graph search algorithm applied to a novel multi-resolution state lattice, where the resolution is adapted based on both environmental characteristics and task characteristics. In addition, we present a novel approach for generating fast globally optimal trajectories in constrained spaces (i.e. rooms connected via doors and hallways). This approach exploits offline precomputation to provide extremely efficient online performance and is applicable to a wide range of both indoor and outdoor navigation scenarios. By combining an anytime, multi-resolution lattice-based search algorithm with our precomputation technique, globally optimal trajectories in up to four dimensions (2D position, heading and velocity) are obtained in real-time.},

Using this idea, we formulate an arbitrarily fine relaxation of the path planning problem as a nonconvex feasibility optimization problem. Then, we propound a nonsmooth dynamical systems approach to find feasible solutions of this optimization problem. It is shown that the trajectories of the nonsmooth dynamical system always converge to some equilibria that correspond to the set of feasible solutions of the relaxed problem.

abstract={This paper presents ICS-AVOID, a collision avoidance scheme based upon the concept of Inevitable Collision State (ICS), ie a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory of the robotic system is, a collision eventually occurs. By design, ICS-AVOID can handle dynamic environments since ICS do take into account the future behaviour of moving objects. ICS-AVOID is designed to keep the system away from ICS. By doing so, motion safety is guaranteed (by definition a robotic system in a non-ICS state has at least one collision-free trajectory that it can use). To demonstrate the efficiency of ICS-AVOID, it has been extensively compared with two state-of-the-art collision avoidance schemes: the first one is built upon the Dynamic Window approach and the second one on the Velocity Obstacle concept. The results obtained show that, when provided with the same amount of information about the future evolution of the environment, ICS-AVOID outperforms the other two schemes. The first reason for this has to do with the extent to which each collision avoidance scheme reasons about the future. The second reason has to do with the ability of each collision avoidance scheme to find a safe control if one exists. ICS-AVOID is the only one which is complete in this respect thanks to the concept of Safe Control Kernel.},

However, these two questions have been difficult to answer, even when adaptive methods meant to facilitate a solution are applied. For example, adaptive solutions such as setting learning rates, hand-classifying spaces, and defining parameters for a library of planners have all been proposed. We demonstrate a strategy based on unsupervised learning methods that makes adaptive planning more practical. The unsupervised strategies require less user intervention, model the topology of the problem in a reasonable and efficient manner, can adapt the sampler depending on characteristics of the problem, and can easily accept new samplers as they become available. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that in a wide variety of environments, the regions automatically identified by our technique represent the planning space well both in number and placement. We also show that our technique has little overhead and that it out-performs two existing adaptive methods in all complex cases studied.},

abstract={The goal of motion planning is to find a feasible path that connects two positions and is free from collision with obstacles. Path sets are a robust approach to this problem in the face of real-world complexity and uncertainty. A path set is a collection of feasible paths and their corresponding control sequences. A path-set-based planner navigates by repeatedly testing each of these robot-fixed paths for collision with obstacles. A heuristic function selects which of the surviving paths to follow next. At each step, the robot follows a small piece of each path selected while simultaneously planning the subsequent trajectory. A path set possesses high path diversity if it performs well at obstacle-avoidance and goal-seeking behaviors. Previous work in path diversity has tacitly assumed that a correlation exists between this dynamic planning problem and a simpler, static path diversity problem: a robot placed randomly into an obstacle field evaluates its path set for collision a single time before following the chosen path in entirety. Although these problems might intuitively appear to be linked, this paper shows that static and dynamic path diversity are two distinct properties. After empirically demonstrating this fact, we discuss some of the factors that differentiate the two problems.},

It is hard because (1) objects are constrained in position and orientation, (2) many non-spatial constraints interact (or interfere) with each other, and (3) robots may have multi-degree of freedoms (DOF). In this paper we solve the problem of general purpose robotic manipulation using a novel combination of planning and motion planning. Our approach integrates motions of a robot with other (non-physical or external-to-robot) actions to achieve a goal while manipulating objects. It differs from previous, hierarchical approaches in that (a) it considers kinematic constraints in configuration space (C-space) together with constraints over object manipulations; (b) it automatically generates high-level (logical) actions from a C-space based motion planning algorithm; and (c) it decomposes a planning problem into small segments, thus reducing the complexity of planning.},

    abstract={Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are widely used to solve large planning problems where the scope prohibits the feasibility of deterministic solvers, but the efficiency of these algorithms can be severely compromised in the presence of certain kinodynamics constraints. Obstacle fields with tunnels, or tubes are notoriously difficult, as are systems with differential constraints, because the tree grows inefficiently at the boundaries. Here we present a new sampling strategy for the RRT algorithm, based on an estimated feasibility set, which affords a dramatic improvement in performance in these severely constrained systems. We demonstrate the algorithm with a detailed look at the expansion of an RRT in a swing up task, and on path planning for a nonholonomic car.},

In the proposed method the goal is to find all the physically admissible subassemblies in which a set of objects can be disassembled and to identify feasible disassembly motions. Stability of object configurations under the effect of gravity and friction is computed by relying on a physics-based animation engine. We propose efficient strategies to reduce computational time that take into account precedence relations, arising from user assembly demonstrations as well as geometrical clustering. We have also developed a motion planning technique for generating non-destructive disassembly paths on a query-based approach.

This algorithm, named Incremental Adaptive Random Walks (iARW), uses a modified version of the ARW algorithm proposed by Carpin and Pillonetto for exploring the configuration space and storing the discovered path in a roadmap. Thus, the main idea is to use bidirectional adaptive random walks to explore the configuration space but also to use and expand the roadmap whenever possible.With this approach it is possible to construct a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free configuration space without a preprocessing phase. A comparison of our approach with other state of the art path planners illustrates the good performance of the proposed method.},

abstract={The ability of mobile robots to generate feasible trajectories online is an important requirement for their autonomous operation in unstructured environments. Many path generation techniques focus on generation of time- or distance-optimal paths while obeying dynamic constraints, and often assume precise knowledge of robot and/or environmental (i.e. terrain) properties. In uneven terrain, it is essential that the robot mobility over the terrain be explicitly considered in the planning process. Further, since significant uncertainty is often associated with robot and/or terrain parameter knowledge, this should also be accounted for in a path generation algorithm. Here, extensions to the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm are presented that explicitly consider robot mobility and robot parameter uncertainty based on the stochastic response surface method (SRSM). Simulation results suggest that the proposed approach can be used for generating safe paths on uncertain, uneven terrain.},

abstract={We address the motion planning problem for a manipulator system with base pose uncertainty, e.g., when the manipulator is mounted on a mobile base. Using a particle based representation for the uncertainty, we extend the PRM (probabilistic roadmap) approach to deal with this base uncertainty. Because of the uncertainty, a path for the manipulator is associated with a probability of being collision-free, which fundamentally changes the nature of the PRM's query phase. We plan for a shortest path such that the probability of the manipulator being collision-free is higher than a user defined threshold, were the manipulator to follow the path. The path query problem becomes a collision probability constrained shortest path problem (CP-CSPP), and is shown as NP-hard w.r.t. the number of the particles. We then present a lazy query algorithm, called Lazy-CPC-PRM (collision probability constrained LazyPRM), based on a k-shortest path algorithm in conjunction with a labeling algorithm. Lazy-CPC-PRM exploits a key insight that if a portion of a path considered by the algorithm is invalid (the probability of it being collision-free is less than a threshold) or is dominated by another sub-path, then all the longer paths containing this portion can not be the solution path. This leads to significant efficiency gains in practice. Although, worst case complexity is exponential in the number of particles, we empirically show the effectiveness of our query algorithm with 30 particles for a simulated 3-dof manipulator mounted on a mobile base.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel planner for manipulators and robots in changing environments. When environments are complicated, it's always difficult to find a completely valid path solution, which is essential for many methods. However, our planner searches for several path segments to make robot move towards its goal as much as possible even though such a complete solution doesn't exist currently. In the learning phase, the planner begins by building a roadmap that captures the topological structure of the configuration space in a workspace without obstacles. In the query phase, the planner searches for a solution path in the roadmap with the A* algorithm and performs roadmap updating using the lazy evaluation idea concurrently with the solution search process. If a completely valid solution is found, it will be adopted immediately. Otherwise the planner will collect a set of maximum valid path segments and then select the optimal one for planning in the execution process. The searching and execution process will be repeatedly performed until a goal configuration is reached. In plentiful experiments, our planner shows promising performances.},

	abstract={We propose a novel approach for smoothing surfaces represented by triangular meshes. The proposed method is a two-step procedure: surface normal smoothing through fuzzy vector median (FVM) filtering followed by integration of surface normals for vertex position update based on the least square error (LSE) criteria. Median and order statistic-based filters are extensively used in signal processing, especially image processing, due to their ability to reject outliers and preserve features such as edges and monotonic regions. More recently, fuzzy ordering theory has been introduced to allow averaging among similarly valued samples. Fuzzy ordering theory leads naturally to the fuzzy median, which yields improved noise smoothing over traditional crisp median filters. We extend the fuzzy ordering concept to vector-based data and introduce the fuzzy vector median filter. The application of FVM filters to surface normal smoothing yields improved results over previously introduced normal smoothing algorithms. The improved filtering results, coupled with LSE vertex position update, produces surface smoothing that minimizes the effects of noise while simultaneously preserving detail features. The proposed method is simple to implement and relatively fast. Simulation results are presented showing the performance of the proposed method and its advantages over commonly used surface smoothing algorithms. Additionally, optimization procedures for FVM filters are derived and evaluated.},

We study a particular instance of this problem that we refer to as path clearance problem.This article presents a survey of our work on scalable and suitable for real-time use approaches to solving the path clearance problem. In particular, in the first part of the article, we show that the path clearance problem exhibits clear preferences on uncertainty. It turns out that these clear preferences can be used to develop an efficient algorithm called probabilistic planning with clear preferences (PPCP). The algorithm is anytime usable, converges to an optimal solution under certain conditions, and scales well to large-scale problems. We briefly describe the PPCP algorithm and show how it can be used to solve the path clearance problem when no scouts are present. In the second part of the article, we show several strategies for how to use the PPCP algorithm in case multiple scouting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are available. The experimental analysis shows that planning with PPCP results in a substantially smaller execution cost than when ignoring uncertainty, and employing scouts can decrease this execution cost even further.},

Motion planning has application in many areas such as robotics, virtual reality systems, computer-aided design, and even computational biology. Although there have been steady advances in motion planning algorithms, especially in randomized approaches such as probabilistic roadmap methods (PRMs) or rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), there are still some classes of problems that cannot be solved efficiently using these state-of-the-art motion planners. In this paper, we suggest an iterative strategy addressing this problem where we first simplify the problem by relaxing some feasibility constraints, solve the easier version of the problem, and then use that solution to help us find a solution for the harder problem. We show how this strategy can be applied to rigid bodies and to linkages with high degrees of freedom, including both open and closed chain systems. Experimental results are presented for linkages composed of 9-98 links. Although we use PRMs as the automated planner, the framework is general and can be applied with other motion planning techniques as well.},

The goal shape may be a robot built for a specific task (a snake to pass through a tunnel or a rolling belt to quickly cover open ground) or an object designed for a particular job (such as a wrench, hammer, or bridge). When the task is complete, the modules in the structure can disconnect and be reused to create a different object. This type of self-reconfiguration leads to versatile robots that can support multiple modalities of locomotion, manipulation, and perception.

    abstract={For sensor-based robot motion planning, view planning problem refers to planning the next sensing action to further facilitate the motion planning task. In Y. Yu and K. Gupta (2004), C-space entropy was introduced as a measure of knowledge of robot configuration space, or C-space. The robot plans the next sensing action to maximally reduce the expected C-space entropy, also called the maximal expected entropy reduction, or MER criterion. It was shown that MER criterion resulted in much more efficient C-space exploration performance than physical space based view planning criteria, such as to maximize unknown physical volume in each view. From a C-space perspective, MER criterion consists of two important aspects: sensing actions are evaluated in C-space (geometric aspect); these effects are evaluated in an information theoretical sense (stochastic aspect). In this paper, we investigate how much of this better performance is attributable to the paradigmatic shift to evaluating the sensor action in C-space, i.e., the pure geometric component of MER, and how much is attributable to the stochastic aspect of MER. We propose C-space based pure geometric criteria (which are essentially geometric aspect of MER) for view planning and compare them with the MER criterion. We empirically show that a great deal of efficiency is attributable to the pure geometric aspect; however, we also show that the stochastic aspect, despite being based on simple assumptions, result in moderately more efficient C-space exploration over the pure geometric component of MER. We outline explanations for our findings},

A post-hoc analysis was performed on the data collected during the response, which resulted in 17 findings on the impact of the environment and conditions on the HRI: the skills displayed and needed by robots and humans, the details of the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task, the social informatics in the USAR domain, and what information is communicated at what time. The results of this work impact the field of robotics by providing a case study for HRI in USAR drawn from an unstaged USAR effort. Eleven recommendations are made based on the findings that impact the robotics, computer science, engineering, psychology, and rescue fields. These recommendations call for group organization and user confidence studies, more research into perceptual and assistive interfaces, and formal models of the state of the robot, state of the world, and information as to what has been observed.},

abstract={In many multirobot applications, the specific assignment of goal configurations to robots is less important than the overall behavior of the robot formation. In such cases, it is convenient to define a permutation-invariant multirobot formation as a set of robot configurations, without assigning specific configurations to specific robots. For the case of robots that translate in the plane, we can represent such a formation by the coefficients of a complex polynomial whose roots represent the robot configurations. Since these coefficients are invariant with respect to permutation of the roots of the polynomial, they provide an effective representation for permutation-invariant formations. In this paper, we extend this idea to build a full representation of a permutation-invariant formation space. We describe the properties of the representation, and show how it can be used to construct collision-free paths for permutation-invariant formations},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a statistical algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization. Our approach uses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion. When teams of robots localize themselves in the same environment, probabilistic methods are employed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another. As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiple robot platforms. The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser range-finders for detecting other robots. The results, obtained with the real robots and in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization. A further experiment demonstrates that under certain conditions, successful localization is only possible if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during localization.}},

This paper presents a Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) motion planning algorithm to be queried within Dynamic Robot Networks--a multi-robot coordination platform for robots operating with limited sensing and inter-robot communication.
First, the Dynamic Robot Networks (DRN) coordination platform is introduced that facilitates centralized robot coordination across ad hoc networks, allowing safe navigation in dynamic, unknown environments. As robots move about their environment, they dynamically form communication networks. Within these networks, robots can share local sensing information and coordinate the actions of all robots in the network.
Second, a fast single-query Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) to be called within the DRN platform is presented that has been augmented with new sampling strategies. Traditional PRM strategies have shown success in searching large configuration spaces. Considered here is their application to on-line, centralized, multiple mobile robot planning problems. New sampling strategies that exploit the kinematics of non-holonomic mobile robots have been developed and implemented. First, an appropriate method of selecting milestones in a PRM is identified to enable fast coverage of the configuration space. Second, a new method of generating PRM milestones is described that decreases the planning time over traditional methods. Finally, a new endgame region for multi-robot PRMs is presented that increases the likelihood of finding solutions given difficult goal configurations.
Combining the DRN platform with these new sampling strategies, on-line centralized multi-robot planning is enabled. This allows robots to navigate safely in environments that are both dynamic and unknown. Simulations and real robot experiments are presented that demonstrate: (1) speed improvements accomplished by the sampling strategies, (2) centralized robot coordination across Dynamic Robot Networks, (3) on-the-fly motion planning to avoid moving and previously unknown obstacles and (4) autonomous robot navigation towards individual goal locations."

        Steerable needles can be used in medical applications to reach targets behind sensitive or impenetrable areas. The kinematics of a steerable needle are non-holonomic and, in two dimensions, equivalent to a Dubins car with constant radius of curvature. In three dimensions, the needle can be interpreted as an airplane with constant speed and pitch rate, zero yaw, and controllable roll angle. We present a constant-time motion planning algorithm for steerable needles based on explicit geometric inverse kinematics similar to the classic Padenâ Kahan subproblems. Reachability and path competitivity are analyzed using analytic comparisons with shortest path solutions for the Dubins car (for two dimensions) and numerical simulations (for three dimensions). We also present an algorithm for local path adaptation using null-space results from redundant manipulator theory. Finally, we discuss several ways to use and extend the inverse kinematics solution to generate needle paths that avoid obstacles.

        We propose a representation and a planning algorithm able to deal with problems integrating task planning as well as motion and manipulation planning knowledge involving several robots and objects. Robot plans often include actions where the robot has to place itself in some position in order to perform some other action or to âmodifyâ the configuration of its environment by displacing objects. Our approach aims at establishing a bridge between task planning and manipulation planning that allows a rigorous treatment of geometric preconditions and effects of robot actions in realistic environments. We show how links can be established between a symbolic description and its geometric counterpart and how they can be used in an integrated planning process that is able to deal with intricate symbolic and geometric constraints. Finally, we describe the main features of an implemented planner and discuss several examples of its use.

    abstract ={
        This paper presents a stochastic motion planning algorithm and its application to traffic navigation. The algorithm copes with the uncertainty of road traffic conditions by stochastic modeling of travel delay on road networks. The algorithm determines paths between two points that optimize a cost function of the delay data probability distribution. It can be used to find paths that maximize the probability of reaching a destination within a particular travel deadline. For such problems, standard shortest-path algorithms do not work because the optimal substructure property does not hold. We evaluate our algorithm using both simulations and real-world drives, using delay data gathered from a set of taxis equipped with global positioning system sensors and a wireless network. Our algorithm can be integrated into onboard navigation systems as well as route-finding websites, providing drivers with good paths that meet their desired goals.

With this goal in mind, we develop new methods, combining robotic path planning algorithms and molecular modeling techniques, for computing large-amplitude motions. This paper builds on these new methods, and introduces voxel maps as a computational tool to encode and to represent such motions. Voxel maps can be used to represent relative motions of two molecules, as well as conformational changes in macromolecules. We investigate several applications and show results that illustrate the interest of such representation. In particular, voxel maps are used to display channels into proteins, to analyze protein-ligand specificity, and to represents protein loop and domain motions.},

The underlying geometric model for the volume is provided by a mass-spring representation. It is augmented by a realistic mechanical model. The latter permits the computation of the shape of the considered object with respect to the grasping constraints by minimizing the energy function of the deformation of the object. Previous research in planning for deformable objects considered the case of elastic plates and proposed a randomized framework for planning paths for plates under manipulation constraints. The present paper modifies and extends the previously proposed framework to handle simple volumes. Our planner builds a roadmap in the configuration space. The nodes of the roadmap are equilibrium configurations of the considered volume under the manipulation constraints, while its edges correspond to quasi-static equilibrium paths. Paths are found by searching the roadmap. We present experimental results that illustrate our approach},

We focus on computing the deformation of an object subject to external forces and detecting collisions among deformable and rigid objects. The targeted application domain is surgical training. This application relies more on visual realism than exact, patient-specific deformation, but requires that computations be performed in real time. This is in contrast with pre-operative surgical planning, where computations may be done offline but must provide accurate results. To achieve real-time performance, the proposed algorithms take advantage of the fact that most deformations are local, human-body tissues are well damped, and motions of surgical instruments are relatively slow. They have been integrated into a virtual reality system for simulating the suturing of small blood vessels (microsurgery)},

Representing physical phenomena and, more specifically, the realistic modeling of soft tissue will not only improve current medical simulation systems but will considerably enlarge the set of applications and the credibility of medical simulation, from neurosurgery planning to laparoscopic-surgery simulation. To achieve realistic tissue deformation, it is necessary to combine deformation accuracy with computer efficiency. On the one hand, biomechanics has studied complex mathematical models and produced a large amount of experimental data for accurately representing the deformation of soft tissue. On the other hand, computer graphics has proposed many algorithms for the real-time computation of deformable bodies, often at the cost of ignoring the physics principles. The author surveys existing models of deformation in medical simulation and analyze the impediments to combining computer-graphics representations with biomechanical models. In particular, the different geometric representations of deformable tissue are compared in relation to the tasks of real-time deformation, tissue cutting, and force-feedback interaction. Last, the author inspects the potential of medical simulation under the development of this key technology},

In this review we will provide an overview of available data relevant to systems biology, properties of biological networks, algorithms to compare and align networks and simulation and modeling techniques. Looking towards the future, we will discuss work on integrating additional functional information with biological networks, such as three dimensional structures and the complex environment of the cell. Combining and understanding this information requires development of novel algorithms and data integration techniques and solving these difficult computational problems will advance both computational and biological research."

    abstract = {Depth is a term frequently applied to the shape and surface of macromolecules, describing for example the grooves in DNA, the shape of an enzyme active site, or the binding site for a small molecule in a protein. Yet depth is a difficult property to define rigorously in a macromolecule, and few computational tools exist to quantify this notion, to visualize it, or analyze the results. We present our notion of travel depth, simply put the physical distance a solvent molecule would have to travel from a surface point to a suitably defined reference surface. To define the reference surface, we use the limiting form of the molecular surface with increasing probe size: the convex hull. We then present a fast, robust approximation algorithm to compute travel depth to every surface point. The travel depth is useful because it works for pockets of any size and complexity. It also works for two interesting special cases. First, it works on the grooves in DNA, which are unbounded in one direction. Second, it works on the case of tunnels, that is pockets that have no "bottom", but go through the entire macromolecule. Our algorithm makes it straightforward to quantify discussions of depth when analyzing structures. High-throughput analysis of macromolecule depth is also enabled by our algorithm. This is demonstrated by analyzing a database of protein-small molecule binding pockets, and the distribution of bound magnesium ions in RNA structures. These analyses show significant, but subtle effects of depth on ligand binding localization and strength.}

Travel Depth can be seen as the physical distance a solvent molecule would have to travel from a point of the surface, i.e., the Solvent-Excluded Surface (SES), to its convex hull. Existing algorithms providing an estimation of the Travel Depth are based on a regular sampling of the molecule volume and the use of the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Since Travel Depth is only defined on the molecular surface, this volume-based approach is characterized by a large computational complexity due to the processing of unnecessary samples lying inside or outside the molecule. In this paper, we propose a surface-based approach that restricts the processing to data defined on the SES. This algorithm significantly reduces the complexity of Travel Depth estimation and makes possible the analysis of large macromolecule surface shape description with high resolution. Experimental results show that compared to existing methods, the proposed algorithm achieves accurate estimations with considerably reduced processing times.},

This differs from prior work which performed point correspondence determination and similarity ranking of shapes in separate steps. The proposed method employs selected boundary and/or contour points of an object as a coarse-to-fine shape representation, and does not require extraction of connected boundaries or silhouettes. It is rotation-, translation- and scale-invariant, and can handle mild deformations of objects (e.g. due to partial occlusions or pose variations). Results comparing the unified method with an earlier two-step approach using B-spline-based modal matching and Hausdorff distance ranking are presented on retail and museum catalog style still-image databases."

Different from previous shape-correspondence evaluation methods, the proposed benchmark first generates a large set of synthetic shape instances by randomly sampling a given statistical shape model that defines a ground-truth shape space. We then run a test shape-correspondence algorithm on these synthetic shape instances to identify a set of corresponded landmarks. According to the identified corresponded landmarks, we construct a new statistical shape model, which defines a new shape space. We finally compare this new shape space against the ground-truth shape space to determine the performance of the test shape-correspondence algorithm. In this paper, we introduce three new performance measures that are landmark independent to quantify the difference between the ground-truth and the newly derived shape spaces. By introducing a ground-truth shape space that is defined by a statistical shape model and three new landmark-independent performance measures, we believe the proposed benchmark allows for a more objective evaluation of shape correspondence than previous methods. In this paper, we focus on developing the proposed benchmark for 2D shape correspondence. However it can be easily extended to 3D cases.},

        Collision events between 3D objects in motion in computer animations or simulations are difficult to detect due to the difficulty of accurately sampling the motion paths of objects in space and time. One approach to this problem has been continuous collision detection but because the current approaches process potentially interacting primitive pairs (PIPPs) redundantly. This is time-expensive, especially where there are a large number of PIPPs. In this paper we propose a novel collision detection process that more accurately and robustly detects collisions on simulated meshed deformable surfaces. We embed a new layer, primitive filtering layer (PFL), to extract PIPPs. This has two results. It reduces the number of PIPPs significantly and it means that each interacting primitive pair is processed just one time. Experimental results show that this approach achieves interactive rates for complex deformable surfaces with large contact regions. This is especially practical for cloth dynamics. Our method is efficient, accurate, reliable, and robust even in the presence of objects with sharp features. We also present techniques to implement the method on programmable graphics processing units (GPUs). Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

        Collision handling is a comparatively time-consuming task in dynamic simulations and the computational efficiency of collision handling techniques can vary significantly dependent on the spatial configuration of the environment. These issues have to be addressed in interactive simulations such as games or surgical simulators, where a pre-defined response time should be guaranteed for each simulation step. We present a time-critical collision handling approach for deformable objects. The technique employs spatial subdivision for the detection of collisions and penetration depth information is computed to estimate penalty forces. Detection, penetration depth estimation, and response are divided into atomic tasks. In case of an interruption, the algorithm basically resumes in the next time step. If collisions are not completely handled in one simulation step, the algorithm ensures that persistent collisions are handled in a subsequent simulation step. If an exact response cannot be computed in a given time frame, the algorithm efficiently approximates penalty forces for colliding points. Experiments indicate that the proposed technique provides a physically plausible collision handling in the case of incomplete or inconsistent collision information. User-defined limits for the computation time can be guaranteed with an efficiency gain of up to factor three. Copyright Â© 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

        Motion planning has made few inroads into practical applications in the real world. Practical motion planning involving multiple moving objects with complex geometries requires very fast collision detection. We present an approach to collision detection between moving robots for motion planning. It is based on a spherical hierarchy of detail for nonconvex and curved objects that need not be partitioned into convex ones. We present results that show the stability of the approach regarding the number of polygons used to model the scene. Numerical evidence of the algorithm's efficiency is also shown by several experiments, in which we obtain average intersection detection times of around 1 ms using eight processors for two closely moving robots involving 1900 polygons.Â Â© 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

        Numerous methods have been developed to solve the motion planning problem, among which the Voronoi diagram, visibility graph, and potential fields are well-known techniques. In this paper, a new path planning algorithm is presented where these three methods are integrated for the first time in a single architecture. After constructing the generalized Voronoi diagram of C-space, we introduce a novel procedure for its abstraction, producing a pruned generalized Voronoi diagram. A broad freeway net is then developed through a new Î±-MID (maximal inscribed discs) concept. A potential function is assigned to the net to form an obstacle-free network of valleys. Afterwards we take advantage of a bidirectional search, where the visibility graph and potential field modules execute alternately from both start and goal configurations. A steepest descent mildest ascent search technique is used for local planning and avoiding local minima. The algorithm provides a parametric tradeoff between safest and shortest paths and generally yields shorter paths than the Voronoi and potential field methods, and faster than the visibility graph. It also performs well in complicated environments. Â© 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Using B-spline and clothoid curves, these objective points are converted into a path of finer detail, as requisite to a robot driving controller/tracker.

        Planning collision-free trajectories under real-time restrictions is a challenging topic in robotics. In order to reduce computational cost in the collision avoidance process, some authors have proposed different model representations. This article presents an optimal method able to generate automatically geometric models of the objects in a robotic system. For each object, two models are obtained, i.e., the minimum outer and the maximum inner models. Availability of both models allows one to face more successfully robot motion applications. The geometric modeler is focused on the generation of spherically extended polytopes. Each object to model is represented by a set of points taken from its surface. Models are generated through the application of an iterative process based on the Hough transform. When both outer and inner models have been generated, a parameter for evaluating the quality of the models is introduced. This parameter can be used by a rule-based system for increasing the complexity of the model generated and improving, therefore, the accuracy of the representation.Â Â© 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

        The efficient utilization of the motion capabilities of mobile manipulators, i.e., manipulators mounted on mobile platforms, requires the resolution of the kinematically redundant system formed by the addition of the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the platform to those of the manipulator. At the velocity level, the linearized Jacobian equation for such a redundant system represents an underspecified system of algebraic equations, which can be subject to a varying set of contraints such as a non-holonomic constraint on the platform motion, obstacles in the workspace, and various limits on the joint motions. A method, which we named the Full Space Parameterization (FSP), has recently been developed to resolve such underspecified systems with constraints that may vary in time and in number during a single trajectory. In this article, we first review the principles of the FSP and give analytical solutions for constrained motion cases with a general optimization criterion for resolving the redundancy. We then focus on the solutions to (1) the problem introduced by the combined use of prismatic and revolute joints (a common occurrence in practical mobile manipulators), which makes the dimensions of the joint displacement vector components non-homogeneous, and (2) the treatment of a non-holonomic constraint on the platform motion. Sample implementations on several large-payload mobile manipulators with up to 11 DOF are discussed. Comparative trajectories involving combined motions of the platform and manipulator for problems with obstacle and joint limit constraints, and with non-holonomic contraints on the platform motions, are presented to illustrate the use and efficiency of the FSP approach in complex motion planning problems.

        Discretized distance maps have been used in robotics for path planning and efficient collision detection applications in static environments.1 However, they have been used at the finest level of resolution, thereby making them memory intensive. In this article, we propose an octree-based hierarchical representation for discretized distance maps, called Octree Distance Maps (ODM), and show its use in efficient collision detection. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to consider the use of hierarchical distance maps for collision detection.ODM representation achieves an advantageous compromise between array-based distance maps and ordinary octrees. Compared to the former, ODM requires a fraction of the memory at the expense of somewhat slower collision detection. Compared to the latter, ODM requires slightly more memory but provides a significant improvement in collision detection. ODM is similar to the quadtree distance transforms used in image representation2 but differs significantly in various aspects of distance representation and its use in collision detection since the main motivation behind ODM is efficient collision detection instead of image representation. We then present algorithms for (1) creating an ODM from an octree, and (2) for efficient collision detection based on an ODM. Extensive experiments are then presented and compared with octree-based collision detection. Our experimental results quantify the advantageous compromise achieved by ODM representation.

        An algorithmic approach to path finding is considered for a general class of robotic systems. The basic idea is to formulate an optimization problem over a family of continuous paths which satisfy the specified end conditions and possess robot obstacle collisions. The cost to be minimized depends on penetration growth distance, a new measure for the depth of intersection between a pair of object models. The growth distance and its derivatives with respect to configuration variables describing the orientation and position of the objects can be computed quickly. This is a key factor in attaining acceptable computational times. Strategies that improve the efficiency and reliability of picking the initial paths are considered. Significant reductions in computational time are easily obtained by parallel processing. Numerical examples, including a 6 degrees-of-freedom robot moving in a three-dimensional work space, substantiate the approach.Â Â© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 15: 57â74, 1998},

        This article presents a method for determining smooth and time-optimal path constrained trajectories for robotic manipulators and investigates the performance of these trajectories both through simulations and experiments. The desired smoothness of the trajectory is imposed through limits on the torque rates. The third derivative of the path parameter with respect to time, the pseudo-jerk, is the controlled input. The limits on the actuator torques translate into state-dependent limits on the pseudo-acceleration. The time-optimal control objective is cast as an optimization problem by using cubic splines to parametrize the state space trajectory. The optimization problem is solved using the flexible tolerance method. The experimental results presented show that the planned smooth trajectories provide superior feasible time-optimal motion.Â Â© 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

Our approach efficiently exploits the massive computational capabilities of modern CPUs and GPUs commonly found in off-the-shelf computer systems. The algorithm is specifically tailored to be highly scalable on both the CPU and the GPU sides. We can compute discrete and continuous external and self-collisions of non-penetrating rigid and deformable objects consisting of many tens of thousands of triangles in a few milliseconds on a modern PC. Our approach is orders of magnitude faster than earlier CPU-based approaches and up to twice as fast as the most recent GPU-based techniques.},

The FCNN rule has some interesting properties: it is order independent, its worst-case time complexity is quadratic but often with a small constant prefactor, and it is likely to select points very close to the decision boundary. Furthermore, its structure allows for the triangle inequality to be effectively exploited to reduce the computational effort. The FCNN rule outperformed even here-enhanced variants of existing competence preservation methods both in terms of learning speed and learning scaling behavior and, often, in terms of the size of the model while it guaranteed the same prediction accuracy. Furthermore, it was three orders of magnitude faster than hybrid instance-based learning algorithms on the MNIST and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Face databases and computed a model of accuracy comparable to that of methods incorporating a noise-filtering pass.},

Automatic derivation of controller and estimator equations follows from a geometric task model that is obtained using a systematic task modeling procedure. The approach applies to a large variety of robot systems (mobile robots, multiple robot systems, dynamic human-robot interaction, etc.), various sensor systems, and different robot tasks. Using an example task, this paper shows that iTASC is a powerful tool for multi-sensor integration in robot manipulation. The example task includes multiple sensors: encoders, a force sensor, cameras, a laser distance sensor and a laser scanner. The paper details the systematic modeling procedure for the example task and elaborates on the task specific choice of two types of task coordinates: feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which facilitate the task specification, and uncertainty coordinates to model geometric uncertainty. Experimental results for the example task are presented.},

We describe a subdivision algorithm to produce universal polygonal and polyhedral string folding schemas, and we prove the existence of a continuous motion to reach any such folding.

The goal of the first part is to give the reader a basic understanding of the technical issues and types of approaches in solving the basic path-planning or obstacle-avoidance problem. The second installment will cover more advanced issues, including feedback, differential constraints, and uncertainty. Note that this is a brief tutorial rather than a comprehensive survey of methods. For the lat ter, consult some of the recent textbooks. Motion planning involves getting a robot to automatically determine how to move while avoiding collisions with obstacles. Its original formulation, called the piano mov er's problem, is imagined as determining how to move a complicated piece of furniture through a cluttered house. Have you ever argued about how to move a sofa up a stairwell? It has been clear for several decades that getting robots to reason geometrically about their environments and synthesize such plans is a fundamental difficulty that recurs all over robotics.},

However, the quality of these motion paths (with respect to quality measures, such as path length, clearance, smoothness, or energy) is often notoriously low, especially in high-dimensional configuration spaces. We introduce a simple algorithm to merge an arbitrary number of input motion paths into a hybrid output path of superior quality, for a broad and general formulation of path quality. Our approach is based on the observation that the quality of certain subpaths within each solution may be higher than the quality of the entire path. A dynamic-programming algorithm, which we recently developed to compare and cluster multiple motion paths, reduces the running time of the merging algorithm significantly. We tested our algorithm in motion-planning problems with up to 12 degrees of freedom (DOFs), where our method is shown to be particularly effective. We show that our algorithm is able to merge a handful of input paths produced by several different motion planners to produce output paths of much higher quality.},

Coordination is achieved by planning robot velocities along the paths through a velocity-optimization process. An objective function for minimizing formation errors is established and solved by a linear interactive and general optimizer. Motion planning can be further adjusted online to address emergent demands such as avoiding suddenly appearing obstacles. Simulations and experiments are performed on a group of mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated motion planning in multirobot formations.},

For each sample point, a height function is defined based on the distances of the other sample points to its tangent line. One compact and robust shape descriptor is obtained by smoothing the height functions. The proposed descriptor is not only invariant to geometric transformations such as translation, rotation and scaling but also insensitive to nonlinear deformations due to noise and occlusion. In the matching stage, the Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm is employed to find out the optimal correspondence between sample points of every two shapes. The height function provides an excellent discriminative power, which is demonstrated by excellent retrieval performances on several popular shape benchmarks, including MPEG-7 data set, Kimias data set and ETH-80 data set."

We then propose a shape representation method that fulfills these criteria. In the proposed approach, contour convexities and concavities at different scale levels are represented using a two-dimensional (2-D) matrix. The representation can be visualized as a 2-D surface, where "hills" and "valleys" represent contour convexities and concavities, respectively. The optimal matching of two shape representations is achieved using dynamic programming and a dissimilarity measure is defined based on this matching. The proposed algorithm is very efficient and invariant to several kinds of transformations including some articulations and modest occlusions. The retrieval performance of the approach is illustrated using the MPEG-7 shape database, which is one of the most complete shape databases currently available. Our experiments indicate that the proposed representation is well suited for object indexing and retrieval in large databases. Furthermore, the representation can be used as a starting point to obtain more compact descriptors.},

We model both shape and topology of image objects using a structured representation called curvature tree (CT). The hierarchy of the CT reflects the inclusion relationships between the image objects. To facilitate shape-based matching, triangle-area representation (TAR) of each object is stored at the corresponding node in the CT. The similarity between two multiobject images is measured based on the maximum similarity subtree isomorphism (MSSI) between their CTs. For this purpose, we adopt a recursive algorithm to solve the MSSI problem and a very effective dynamic programming algorithm to measure the similarity between the attributed nodes. Our matching scheme agrees with many recent findings in psychology about the human perception of multiobject images. Experiments on a database of 13,500 real and synthesized medical images and the MPEG-7 CE-1 database of 1,400 shape images have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This includes the ability to match similar parts even when they occur at different scales or positions. While comparison of multiscale shape representations is typically based on specific features, HPM avoids the need to extract such features.

    abstract={In computer vision, shape matching is a challenging problem, especially when articulation and deformation of parts occur. These variations may be insignificant in terms of human recognition, but often cause a matching algorithm to give results that are inconsistent with our perception. In this paper, we propose a novel shape descriptor of planar contours, called contour flexibility, which represents the deformable potential at each point along a contour. With this descriptor, The local and global features can be obtained from the contour. We then present a shape matching scheme based on the features obtained. Experiments with comparisons to recently published algorithms show that our algorithm performs best.},

    abstract={The matching and retrieval of 2D shapes is an important challenge in computer vision. A large number of shape similarity approaches have been developed, with the main focus being the comparison or matching of pairs of shapes. In these approaches, other shapes do not influence the similarity measure of a given pair of shapes. In the proposed approach, other shapes do influence the similarity measure of each pair of shapes, and we show that this influence is beneficial even in the unsupervised setting (without any prior knowledge of shape classes). The influence of other shapes is propagated as a diffusion process on a graph formed by a given set of shapes. However, the classical diffusion process does not perform well in shape space for two reasons: it is unstable in the presence of noise and the underlying local geometry is sparse. We introduce a locally constrained diffusion process which is more stable even if noise is present, and we densify the shape space by adding synthetic points we call 'ghost points'. We present experimental results that demonstrate very significant improvements over state-of-the-art shape matching algorithms. On the MPEG-7 data set, we obtained a bull's-eye retrieval score of 93.32%, which is the highest score ever reported in the literature.},

Most existing shape descriptors are usually either application dependent or non-robust, making them undesirable for generic shape description.

The proposed shape descriptor is derived by applying a 2D Fourier transform on a polar raster sampled shape image. The acquired shape descriptor is application independent and robust.

	abstract = {As robots become more versatile, they are increasingly found to operate together in the same environment where they must coordinate their motion in a distributed manner. Such operation does not present problems if the motion is quasi-static and collisions can be easily avoided. However, when the robots follow second-order dynamics, the problem becomes challenging even for a known environment. The setup in this work considers that each robot replans its own trajectory for the next replanning cycle. The planning process must guarantee the robot{\textquoteright}s safety by ensuring collision-free paths for the considered period and by not bringing the robot to states where collisions cannot be avoided in the future. This problem can be addressed through communication among the robots, but it becomes complicated when the replanning cycles of the different robots are not synchronized and the robots make planning decisions at different time instants. This paper shows how to guarantee the safe operation of multiple communicating second-order vehicles, whose replanning cycles do not coincide, through an asynchronous, distributed motion planning framework. The method is evaluated through simulations, where each robot is simulated on a different processor and communicates with its neighbors through message passing. The simulations confirm that the approach provides safety in scenarios with up to 48 robots with second-order dynamics in environments with obstacles, where collisions occur often without a safety framework.},

Such swarms have been shown to be adaptable, fault-tolerant and widely applicable. However, designing individual robot algorithms to ensure effective and correct overall swarm behaviour is actually very difficult. While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves. However, such simulations or experiments cannot, by their nature, analyse all possible swarm behaviours. In this paper, we will develop and apply the use of automated probabilistic formal verification techniques to robot swarms, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether swarms will indeed behave as required. In particular we consider a foraging robot scenario to which we apply probabilistic model checking."

Similar to prior kinodynamic planning methods, the sampled nodes in our roadmaps are generated based on dynamic simulation. Moreover, we bias these samples by using constraint forces designed to avoid collisions while moving toward the goal configuration. We adaptively reduce the complexity of the state space by determining a subset of joints that contribute most towards the motion and only simulate these joints. Based on these configurations, we compute a valid path that satisfies non-penetration, kinematic, and dynamics constraints. Our approach can be easily combined with a variety of motion planning algorithms including probabilistic roadmaps (PRMs) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) and applied to articulated robots with hundreds of joints. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several challenging benchmarks},

    abstract={ The timing of movements and of action sequences is important when particular events must be achieved in time-varying environments, avoiding moving obstacles or coordinating multiple robots. However, timing is difficult when it must be compatible with continuous on-line coupling to low-level and often noisy sensory information which is used to initiate and steer action. We extended the Dynamic Approach to Behavior Generation to account for timing constraints. We proposed a solution that uses a dynamical system architecture to autonomously generate timed trajectories and sequences of movements as attractor solutions of dynamic systems. The model consists of a two layer architecture, in which a competitive "neural" dynamics layer controls the qualitative dynamics of a second, "timing" layer. The second layer generates both stable oscillations and stationary states, such that periodic attractors generate timed movement. The first layer controls the switching between the limit cycle and the fixed points, allowing for discrete movements and movement sequences. This model was integrated with another dynamical system without timing constraints. The complete dynamical architecture was demonstrated on a vision-guided mobile robot in real time, whose goal is to reach a target in approximately constant time within a non-structured environment. The obtained results illustrated the stability and flexibility properties of the timing architecture as well as the robustness of the proposed decision-making mechanism.},

This requires robust and scalable control algorithms that can form a wide range of user-specified shapes, including shapes that adapt to the environment. Here we present a decentralized algorithm for self-organizing of environmentally-adaptive shapes. We apply it to a chain-style modular robot, configured to form a flexible sheet structure. We show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving a wide class of environmentally-adaptive shapes, and the module control is simple, scalable, robust and provably correct. The algorithm is also self-maintaining: the shape automatically adapts if the environment changes. Finally, we present several applications which can be achieved within this framework via robot prototypes and simulations, such as a self-balancing table. In our experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm is highly responsive and robust in the face of real-world actuation and sensing noise.},

The requirements have been evaluated considering modern manufacturing aspects and a new online robot trajectory planning and programming support system is presented for industrial use. The proposed methodology is executed solely online, rendering offline simulation obsolete and thereby reduces costs. To enable this system, a new cell-based Voronoi generation algorithm, together with a trajectory planner, is introduced.

This algorithm can obtain the environment and vehicle parameters from received experience without needing a mathematical model. The algorithm uses a transformation of the cell-to-cell transitions to reduce the time that is spent in the knowledge of the vehicle dynamics and environment. Four state variables have been considered: 1) the velocity of the vehicle; 2) the x Cartesian coordinate; 3) the y Cartesian coordinate; and 4) the orientation of the vehicle. In addition, two different control actions can act on the vehicle: 1) the traction torque that was used for speeding up/braking the vehicle and 2) the steering angle. The results show the applicability of the proposed algorithm in environments with the presence of obstacles.},

However, almost all these robots were controlled using trajectory planning methods, and few robots realized giant-swing motion by learning. Consequently, in this study, we attempted to construct a humanoid robot that realizes giant-swing motion by Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique. The significant aspect of our study is that few robotic models were constructed beforehand; the robot learns giant-swing motion only by interaction with the environment during simulations. Our implementation faced several problems such as imperfect perception of the velocity state and robot posture issues caused by using only the arm angle. However, our real robot realized giant-swing motion by averaging the Q value and by using rewards - the absolute angle of the foot angle and the angular velocity of the arm angle-in the simulated learning data; the sampling time was 250 ms. Furthermore, the feasibility of generalization of learning for realizing selective motion in the forward and backward rotational directions was investigated; it was revealed that the generalization of learning is feasible as long as it does not interfere with the robot's motions.},

In this method, some LSs are integrated for learning a single task of a single robot. The LSs consists of (1) LS-scratch: learning a policy from scratch, (2) LS-accelerating: learning a policy from a previously learned policy by accelerating motion speed parameters, and (3) LS-freeing: learning a policy from a previously learned policy by increasing the DoF (degree of freedom). The proposed LS fusion method enables (A) in the early stage of learning, LS fusion can select a suitable DoF configuration from a predefined set of DoF configurations, and (B) after a behavior module that learns from scratch converges, the LSs are applied to improve the policy. As a result, a robot can learn a complex task by starting with a simplified configuration, and then transferring the learned behaviors while increasing the difficulty. We introduce WF-DCOB proposed by Yamaguchi et al. for the LSs. We verify the proposed LS fusion method with a crawling task of a humanoid robot. The simulation experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method compared to learning with a single learning module.},

 abstract={Hierarchical organization of behavior and learning is widespread in animals and robots, among others to facilitate dealing with multiple tasks. In hierarchical reinforcement learning, agents usually have to learn to recombine or modulate low-level behaviors when facing a new task, which costs time that could potentially be saved by employing intrinsically adaptive low-level controllers. At the same time, although there exists extensive research on the use of pattern generators as low-level controllers for robot motion, the effect of their potential adaptivity on high-level performance on multiple tasks has not been explicitly studied. This paper investigates this effect using a dynamically simulated hexapod robot that needs to complete a high-level learning task on terrains of varying complexity. Results show that as terrain difficulty increases and adaptivity to environmental disturbances becomes more important, low-level controllers with a degree of instability have a positive impact on high-level performance. In particular, these controllers provide an initial performance boost that is maintained throughout learning, showing that their instability does not negatively affect their predictability, which is important for learning.},

    abstract={The goal of this research is to enable mobile robots to navigate through crowded environments such as indoor shopping malls, airports, or downtown side walks. The key research question addressed in this paper is how to learn planners that generate human-like motion behavior. Our approach uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn human-like navigation behavior based on example paths. Since robots have only limited sensing, we extend existing IRL methods to the case of partially observable environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic crowd flow simulator in which we modeled multiple scenarios in crowded environments. We show that our planner learned to guide the robot along the flow of people when the environment is crowded, and along the shortest path if no people are around.},

    abstract={For large self-reconfiguring robots, any algorithm that requires linear amounts of memory per module (with respect to the number of modules) or linear time for computation or communication per actuation is undesirable. While shape-forming may require linear amounts of memory, locomotion can be performed with simpler shape specifications, and therefore sublinear algorithms are possible. In this paper, we present a locomotion technique that performs both planning and actuation control in sublinear time and memory. The algorithm is inspired by reinforcement learning and uses dynamic programming to plan module paths in parallel. To ensure the physical integrity of the overall robot during motion, we have developed a novel localized cooperation scheme which may also be used with other self-reconfiguration algorithms. Our overall algorithm is able to direct locomotion over arbitrary obstacles, and the formulation of the goal used in the planning encourages dynamic stability},

    abstract={Physical contact events often allow a natural decomposition of manipulation tasks into action phases and subgoals. Within the motion primitive paradigm, each action phase corresponds to a motion primitive, and the subgoals correspond to the goal parameters of these primitives. Current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms are able to efficiently and robustly optimize the parameters of motion primitives in very high-dimensional problems. These algorithms often consider only shape parameters, which determine the trajectory between the start- and end-point of the movement. In manipulation, however, it is also crucial to optimize the goal parameters, which represent the subgoals between the motion primitives. We therefore extend the policy improvement with path integrals (PI2) algorithm to simultaneously optimize shape and goal parameters. Applying simultaneous shape and goal learning to sequences of motion primitives leads to the novel algorithm PI2 Seq. We use our methods to address a fundamental challenge in manipulation: improving the robustness of everyday pick-and-place tasks.},

    abstract = "Abstract This paper presents a homogeneous modular robot system design based on four per-module degrees of freedom (DOF), including a prismatic DOF to increase the versatility of its reconfiguration and locomotion capabilities. The ModRED (Modular Robot for Exploration and Discovery) modules are developed with rotary-plate genderless single sided docking mechanisms (RoGenSiD) that allow chain-type configurations and lead towards hybrid-type configurations. Various locomotion gaits are simulated through the Webots robot simulator and implemented in the real ModRED system. This work also addresses the problem of dynamic reconfiguration in a modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSR). The self-reconfiguration problem is modeled as an instance of the graph-based coalition formation problem. We formulate the problem as a linear program that finds the ¿best¿ partition or coalition structure among a set of ModRED modules. The technique is verified experimentally for a variety of settings on an accurately simulated model of the ModRED robot within the Webots robot simulator. Our experimental results show that our technique can find the best partition with a reasonably low computational overhead. "

This algorithm also find, for every cell in the map, the point sequence to the goal (path smoothing), without post processing. These point sequences are computing by visibility verification between cells.},

    abstract = "Abstract This paper surveys strategies applied to avoid premature convergence in Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Genetic Algorithm belongs to the set of nature inspired algorithms. The applications of GA cover wide domains such as optimization, pattern recognition, learning, scheduling, economics, bioinformatics, etc. Fitness function is the measure of GA, distributed randomly in the population. Typically, the particular value for each gene start dominating as the search evolves. During the evolutionary search, fitness decreases as the population converges, this leads to the problems of the premature convergence and slow finishing. In this paper, a detailed and comprehensive survey of different approaches implemented to prevent premature convergence with their strengths and weaknesses is presented. This paper also discusses the details about GA, factors affecting the performance during the search for global optima and brief details about the theoretical framework of Genetic algorithm. The surveyed research is organized in a systematic order. A detailed summary and analysis of reviewed literature are given for the quick review. A comparison of reviewed literature has been made based on different parameters. The underlying motivation for this paper is to identify methods that allow the development of new strategies to prevent premature convergence and the effective utilization of genetic algorithms in the different area of research.

Based on such principles, we developed a neuromechanical controller consisting of a modular neural network (MNN) and of virtual agonist¿antagonist muscle mechanisms (VAAMs). The controller allows for variable compliant leg motions of a hexapod robot, thereby leading to energy-efficient walking on different surfaces. Without any passive mechanisms or torque and position feedback at each joint, the variable compliant leg motions are achieved by only changing the stiffness parameters of the VAAMs. In addition, six surfaces can be also classified by observing the motor signals generated by the controller. The performance of the controller is tested on a physical hexapod robot. Experimental results show that it can effectively walk on six different surfaces with the specific resistances between 9.1 and 25.0, and also classify them with high accuracy. "

The context of this work is the development of new-generation systems that combine artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques in order to adjust the learning process to specific needs of a trainee, while preventing a trainee from the memorization of particular task settings. The problem described in the paper is the generation of shortest, collision-free trajectories for laparoscopic instrument movements in the rigid block world used for hand¿eye coordination tasks. Optimal trajectories are displayed on a monitor to provide continuous visual guidance for optimal navigation of instruments. The key result of the work is a framework for the transition from surgical training systems in which users are dependent on predefined task settings and lack guidance for optimal navigation of laparoscopic instruments, to the so called intelligent systems that can potentially deliver the utmost flexibility to the learning process. A preliminary empirical evaluation of the developed optimal motion planning method has demonstrated the increase of total scores measured by total time taken to complete the task, and the instrument movement economy ratio. Experimentation with different task settings and the technical enhancement of the visual guidance are subjects of future research. "

For this purpose, a measure based on the factor needed to shrink the robot's geometry model in a certain configuration to get it free of collisions is defined. This measure serves as a potential and is used to modify whole trajectories. The planning information is evaluated locally, no preprocessing or global potential diffusion is required. To overcome local minima, the planner is embedded in a random global exploration algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the power of this approach},

    abstract={Sampling-based solutions to the motion planning problem, such as the probabilistic roadmap method (PRM), have become commonplace in robotics applications. These solutions are the norm as the dimensionality of the planning space grows, i.e., d >; 5. An important primitive of these methods is the local planner, which is used for validation of simple paths between two configurations. The most common is the straight-line local planner which interpolates along the straight line between the two configurations. In this paper, we introduce a new local planner, Toggle Local Planner (Toggle LP), which extends local planning to a two-dimensional subspace of the overall planning space. If no path exists between the two configurations in the subspace, then Toggle LP is guaranteed to correctly return false. Intuitively, more connections could be found by Toggle LP than by the straight-line planner, resulting in better connected roadmaps. As shown in our results, this is the case, and additionally, the extra cost, in terms of time or storage, for Toggle LP is minimal. Additionally, our experimental analysis of the planner shows the benefit for a wide array of robots, with DOF as high as 70.},

    abstract={The distinctive feature of modular robots consists in their reconfigurable mechanical structure, as they are assembled on-demand from basic mechatronic units. This implies that kinematic models of the robots need to be computed on a case-by-case basis for each specific assembly, which is a manual and hence time-consuming and error-prone procedure. We propose to automate this process by automatically computing such kinematic models starting from simple descriptions of the modules and their assemblies. This automated computation is supported by our toolchain for programming arbitrary modular robots in arbitrary configurations, presented in this paper. We contribute two novel results through this approach. First, a high-level programming language that provides kinematic abstractions for arbitrary modular robots, in contrast to the robot-specific solutions currently available. Second, a programming abstraction to subsume multiple kinematically equivalent robot assemblies into a so-called kinematic configuration, hence eliminating the need to explicitly enumerate and program each of them. These contributions advance current techniques for modular robot programming by demonstrating a tool that a) targets multiple mechanical platforms, offering the first general solution for modular robot programming, and b) raises the abstraction level by allowing users to reason and program in terms of standardized kinematic models that are automatically mapped to physical robot configurations by the toolchain.},

We calculate the arrival time field as a bias which gives larger weights for shorter and safer paths towards a goal. We apply a randomized path search guided by the arrival time field for constructing the path considering kinematic and dynamic (kinodynamic) constraints of actual robot. We also consider path quality by adding heuristic constraints such as directing the initial heading of the robot and reducing unstable movements of the robot by using a heading criterion. The path will be extracted by backtracking the nodes which reach the goal area to the root of the tree generated by the randomized search. We provide a brief comparison between our algorithm and other existing algorithms. Simulation and experimental results prove that our algorithm is fast enough to be applied to the real robot and show the effectiveness of the algorithm for handling kinodynamic problems.},

With motion planning becoming more computationally demanding, we turn to parallel motion planning for efficient solutions. Existing work on distributed RRTs has been limited by the overhead that global communication requires. A recent approach, Radial RRT, demonstrated a scalable algorithm that subdivides the space into regions to increase the computation locality. However, if an obstacle completely blocks RRT growth in a region, the planning space is not covered and is thus not probabilistically complete. We present a new algorithm, Blind RRT, which ignores obstacles during initial growth to efficiently explore the entire space. Because obstacles are ignored, free components of the tree become disconnected and fragmented. Blind RRT merges parts of the tree that have become disconnected from the root. We show how this algorithm can be applied to the Radial RRT framework allowing both scalability and effectiveness in motion planning. This method is a probabilistically complete approach to parallel RRTs. We show that our method not only scales but also overcomes the motion planning limitations that Radial RRT has in a series of difficult motion planning tasks.},

CARRT¿ can account for the CPU's cache size in a manner that keeps its working dataset in the cache. The motion planner progressively subdivides the robot's configuration space into smaller regions as the number of configuration samples rises. By focusing configuration exploration in a region for periods of time, nearest neighbor searching is accelerated since the working dataset is small enough to fit in the cache. CARRT¿ also rewires the motion planning graph in a manner that complements the cache-aware subdivision strategy to more quickly refine the motion planning graph toward optimality. We demonstrate the performance benefit of our cache-aware motion planning approach for scenarios involving a point robot as well as the Rethink Robotics Baxter robot.},

Our method uses sampling cloud for allocating samples on promising regions. Our sampling cloud consists of a set of spheres containing a portion of the C-space. In particular, each sphere projects to a collision-free spherical region in the workspace. We initialize our sampling cloud by conducting a workspace analysis based on the generalized Voronoi graph. We then update our sampling cloud to refine the current best solution, while maintaining the global sampling distribution for exploring understudied other homotopy classes. We have applied our method to a 2D motion planning problem with kinematic constraints, i.e., the Dubins vehicle model, and compared it against the state-of-the-art methods. We achieve better performance, up to three times, over prior methods in a robust manner.},

In order to generate a smooth trajectory for the vehicle to execute, a post-process algorithm with trajectory optimization is proposed. For the purpose of demonstrate benefits of our method, the proposed motion planner is implemented and tested on a real autonomous vehicle in cluttered scenarios with narrow passages. Experimental results show that our planner achieves up to 13.8 times and 7.6 times performance improvements over a basic RRT planner and a Bi-RRT planner respectively.

Namely, the solution extracted from LBT-RRT converges to a solution that is within an approximation factor of 1 + ¿ of the optimal solution. Our algorithm allows for a continuous interpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal RRT* and RRG algorithms. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no approximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like the RRT* algorithm. When the approximation factor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like the RRT algorithm. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to produce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster than RRT* would run. This is done by maintaining a tree which is a sub-graph of the RRG roadmap and a second, auxiliary tree, which we call the lower-bound tree. The combination of the two trees, which is faster to maintain than the tree maintained by RRT*, efficiently guarantee asymptotic near-optimality. We suggest to use LBT-RRT for high-quality, anytime motion planning. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for scenarios ranging from 3 to 12 degrees of freedom and show that even for small approximation factors, the algorithm produces high-quality solutions (comparable to RRT*) with little runtime overhead when compared to RRT.},

    abstract={This paper presents a biomimetic approach based on central pattern generator (CPG), to control turning motion of a snake-like robot. One of the interesting features of a biological snake is its ability to avoid obstacles or a barrier by turning its whole body from its trajectory. This special obstacle avoidance motion is different from other types of animal, and thus, it is worth to be analyzed and realized into a snake-like robot. The paper first briefly explains: 1) the phase oscillator model which represents the CPG model and 2) the CPG network. Next, we address several issues related to the existing/typical turning control of a snake-like robot. We then propose the phase transition method utilizing the phase difference control parameter to realize the turning motion of a snake-like robot. We also introduce a new parameter to control the turning of the robot, where it provides a way to incorporate sensory feedback into the CPG model. Simulation results show that the proposed turning method can be used efficiently as an obstacle avoidance method for a snake-like robot.},

It is also featured by a stochastic relaxation process, which allows the system to converge to a given target structure by searching for a proper unit motion over many degrees of freedom.

This process, called self-assembly, is realized by identical software on each unit with local inter-unit communication. An extension of self-assembly, self-repair, is also examined. In this process, an occasional cut-off of an arbitrary part of the system is assumed. When some part of the system detects damage, the whole system degenerates and reconstructs itself.

    abstract={ A modular robot has a distributed mechanical composition which can make various configurations and also make locomotion in a wide variety of configurations. Modular robots are thought to be useful in extreme or unknown environments by adaptively changing their shape and locomotion patterns. As for locomotion, two types can be used; one is whole-body fixed-configuration locomotion and the other is locomotion by self-reconfiguration. In this paper we deal with the former type of locomotion which is realized by coordinated joint actuation. So far, proposed control methods for whole-body locomotion by modular robots have been based on predefined locomotion sequences. However, locomotion based on predefined sequences cannot adapt to changing terrain conditions such as uphill, downhill, slippery and sticky grounds. To solve such problems, we propose a distributed control mechanism using a CPG controller which enables adaptive locomotion by modular robots. Besides the real-time CPG control we introduce a decentralized control mechanism for detecting the situation that the robot is stuck and initiating transformation to another shape for recovering the situation. The results of various hardware experiments by 4-legged structure prove the feasibility of the method for adaptive locomotion and transformation by our M-TRAN II modules.},

    abstract={Biomimetic robots are a new and challenging frontier for robotic systems. Designs inspired by nature are creating new approaches to problems such as to planetary surface exploration, minimally invasive surgery, or inspection of piping and cabling. However, these new biomimetic robotic systems are a challenge to design, simulate, and control. This paper presents a case-study in the design and physics-based simulation of a unique snake-inspired robot. The Drexel Snake Robot is a novel hybrid capable of both undulatory and rectilinear motion. In order to design gaits, test control algorithms and perform path planning for this robot, we develop a system-level physics-based simulation that captures engineering phenomena across many disciplines: mechanical, electrical, software, electronics, and the robot's external environment. As the snake robot moves, there is considerable slippage between its feet and the ground. Consequently, contact and friction forces play a significant role in dictating the path followed by the robot for a given set of joint motions. A closed-form equation (or set of equations) describing the robot's motion in this environment cannot be derived in a simple manner. Consequently, the material presented here are based the comparison of experimental and simulation results. While developing the simulation model, we detail the process of extracting necessary physical, kinematic and dynamics properties directly from the robot's computer-aided design. This process is not straightforward and the paper documents the issues and lessons learned that will be of use to others wishing to create full virtual models for their systems. Finally, we show how to calibrate the simulation model for fidelity and accuracy with several examples showing that it can be used to test gait and mobility patterns and identify nonobvious secondary phenomena to emerge from the design.},

    abstract={ A method for behavior planning is presented for a modular robot that applies a randomized planner to coherent structure of the robot. To cope with difficulty in planning of many degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a modular robot, coherent structure is introduced in terms of control system and robot configuration. As the control system, a simple phase synchronization mechanism is introduced that can control the robot with many DOFs with reduced number of parameters. Together with symmetrical configuration, this control system generates various dynamic motions. In order to plan the behaviors of the modular robot determined by the parameters of the control system, we adopt a randomized planner called rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs). This can benefit from a number of advantages of RRT planner, including simple implementation, uniform search, and applicability to a dynamic system with differential constraints. By exploring parameter space of the coherent control system, behaviors including dynamic motions can be planned. We have applied the proposed planner to M-TRAN modular robot to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through preliminary simulation results.},

    abstract={ Locomotion, one of the most basic robotic functions, has been widely studied for several types of robots. As for self-reconfigurable modular robots, there are two types of locomotion; one type is realized as a series of self-reconfiguration and the other is realized as a whole body motion such as walking and crawling. Even for the latter type of locomotion, designing control method is more difficult than ordinary robots. This is because the module configuration includes many degrees of freedom and there are a wide variety of possible configurations. We propose an offline method to generate a locomotion pattern automatically for a modular robot in an arbitrary module configuration, which utilizes a neural oscillator as a controller of the joint motor and evolutionary computation method for optimization of the neural oscillator network, which determines the performance of locomotion. We confirm the validity of the method by software simulation and hardware experiments.},

    abstract={Probabilistic roadmap planners have been used with success to plan paths for flexible objects such as metallic plates or plastic flexible pipes. This paper improves the performance of these planners by using the medial axis of the workspace to guide the random sampling. At a preprocessing stage, the medial axis of the workspace is computed using a recent efficient algorithm. Then the flexible object is fitted at random points along the medial axis. The energy of all generated configurations is minimized and the planner proceeds to connect them with low-energy quasi-static paths in a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free space. Given an initial and a final configuration, the planner connects these to the roadmap and searches the roadmap for a path. Our experimental results show that the new sampling scheme is successful in identifying critical deformations of the object along solution paths which results in a significant reduction of the computation time. Our work on planning for flexible objects has applications in industrial settings, virtual reality environments, and medicine},

    abstract={A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation ( ap;150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds)},

The approach extends the probabilistic roadmap technique which has previously been applied to rigid and elastic objects, and articulated robots without closed chains. It provides a framework for path planning problems that must satisfy closure constraints in addition to standard collision constraints. This expands the power of the probabilistic roadmap technique to include a variety of problems such as manipulation planning using two open-chain manipulators that cooperatively grasp an object, forming a system with a closed chain, and planning for reconfigurable robots where the robot links may be rearranged in a loop to ease manipulation or locomotion. We generate the vertices and edges in our probabilistic roadmap. We focus on the problem of planning the motions for a collection of attached links in a 2D environment with obstacles. The approach has been implemented and successfully demonstrated on several examples},

Over the past two decades, significant work has been published in this field, particularly in the aspects of autonomy, mobility and docking. This paper reviews the primary methods in the literature related to the fields of modular and reconfigurable mobile robotics. By bringing together aspects of modularity, including docking and autonomy, and synthesizing the most relevant findings, there is optimism that a more complete understanding of this field will serve as a starting ground for innovation and integration of such technology in the urban environment."

The entire motor repertoire can be spanned by applying a well-defined set of operations and transformations to these primitives and by combining them in many different ways according to well-defined syntactic rules. Motor and movement primitives and modules might exist at the neural, dynamic and kinematic levels with complicated mapping among the elementary building blocks subserving these different levels of representation. Hence, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in unravelling the nature of these primitives, new experimental, computational and conceptual approaches are needed to further advance our understanding of motor compositionality."

    abstract={ A novel model for dynamic emergence and adaptation of embodied behavior is proposed. A musculo-skeletal system is controlled by a number of chaotic elements, each of which driving a muscle based on local sensory feedback. Thus, the chaotic elements interact with each other through the physical body and the environment. This overall structure is modelled as a coupled chaotic system, which has been known in the complex systems science for its capability of creating and moving among extremely rich variety of ordered patterns. In our model, body-environment interaction dynamics, or embodiment, serves as the chaos coupling field, which is nonlinear and time-varying. Theoretically very little is known about such cases, but since the coupling field directly reflects the current body-environment dynamics, we believe that the emergent ordered patterns correspond to useful motor coordination patterns which immediately get reorganized in response to dynamically changing environmental situation. We implemented the above model and carried out a series of experiments using a dynamics simulator. The results confirmed the above conjecture. In a "muscle-joint" model and a "multi-legged insect" model, the systems autonomously explored and found meaningful motor behaviors within a few seconds. And when the environmental condition changes they immediately created novel motor patterns, which comply with the new situation. Unlike existing learning methods, our model does not require long training period or well designed reward function. The emergence and adaptation takes place immediately, and yet effective in the current embodied situation. Furthermore, we present a methodology to introduce "goal-directedness" to the system without destroying its emergent property.},

    abstract={This paper presents a role-based approach to the problem of controlling locomotion of chain-type self-reconfigurable robots. In role-based control, all modules are controlled by identical controllers. Each controller consists of several playable roles and a role-selection mechanism. A role represents the motion of a module and how it synchronizes with connected modules. A controller selects which role to play depending on the local configuration of the module and the roles being played by connected modules. We use role-based control to implement a sidewinder and a caterpillar gait in the CONRO self-reconfigurable robot. The robot is made from up to nine modules connected in a chain. We show that the locomotion speed of the caterpillar gait is constant even with loss of 75% of the communication signals. Furthermore, we show that the speed of the caterpillar gait decreases gracefully with a decreased number of modules. We also implement a quadruped gait and show that without changing the controller the robot can be extended with an extra pair of legs and produce a hexapod gait. Based on these experiments, we conclude that role-based control is robust to signal loss, scales with an increased number of modules, and is a simple approach to the control of locomotion of chain-type self-reconfigurable robots.},

The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed."

To accomplish this task, we attached passive rollers to the modular robot, and designed a wheeled locomotion gait called tricycleBot. The gait is inspired by paddling motion, and is implemented on the modular robot called SuperBot. Features of this gait are systematically studied and verified through extensive experiments. It is shown that tricycleBot can carry payloads at least 530% of its own weight. It can also be steered remotely to move forward/backward, turn left/right. Capability of tricycleBot demonstrates that the versatility of modular robot can be further expanded to solve very specialized and challenging tasks by using heterogeneous devices.},

MSR (modular self-reconfigurable) robot is a class of robot that best demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed systems, as all modules in the robot are individuals that perform their own actuation and computation; the behavior of the complete robot is a collective behavior of all independent modules. In this paper, a general control framework, named general suppression framework, is proposed and a distributed control system based on the framework is presented. The control system is designed to control a set of MSR robots configured into a planar manipulator arm. All modules in the manipulator arm contain their own processing and actuation units, which allow them to evaluate and react to the environment independently. The modules can perform passive communication with their immediate neighbors and can exhibit aggressive or tolerant behavior based on the environment change to generate emergent group behaviors. A simulation program is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed system in controlling the module based planar manipulator arm.},

Our recently developed module is self-reconfigurable. A group of the modules can thus generate various three-dimensional robotic structures and motions. Although the module itself is a simple mechanism, self-reconfiguration planning for locomotion presents a computationally difficult problem due to the many combinatorial possibilities of modular configurations. In this paper, we develop a two-layered planning method for locomotion of a class of regular structures. This locomotion mode is based on multi-module blocks. The upper layer plans the overall cluster motion called flow to realize locomotion along a given desired trajectory; the lower layer determines locally cooperative module motions, called motion schemes, based on a rule database. A planning simulation demonstrates that this approach effectively solves the complicated planning problem. Besides the fundamental motion capacity of the module, the hardware feasibility of the planning locomotion is verified through a self-reconfiguration experiment using the prototype modules we have developed.},

A genetic algorithm is used for evolving the architecture of a connectionist model which determines the muscular activity of a simulated body in interaction with water. This work is inspired by the biological model developed by Ekeberg which repro duces the central pattern generator observed in the real lamprey (Ekeberg, 1993). In evolving artificial controllers, we demonstrate that a genetic algorithm can be an interesting design tech nique for neural controllers and that there exist alternative solutions to the biological connectiv ity. A variety of neural controllers are evolved which can produce the pattern of oscillations necessary for swimming. These patterns can be modulated through the external excitation ap plied to the network in order to vary the speed and the direction of swimming. The best evolved controllers cover larger ranges of frequencies, phase lags and speeds of swimming than Ekeberg's model. We also show that the same techniques for evolving artificial solutions can be interesting tools for developing neurobiological models. In particular, biologically plausible controllers can be developed with ranges of oscillation frequency much closer to those observed in the real lamprey than Ekeberg's hand-crafted model.},

The proposed method formulates the nonlinear system identification as an optimization problem in parameter space, and then adaptive particle swarm optimization are used in the optimization process to find the estimation values of the parameters respectively. Application to Wiener model, in which the nonlinear static subsystems and linear dynamic are separated in different order, is studied and compared with other methods and the simulation results show the identification by adaptive particle swarm optimization is very effective and superior accuracy.},

The new variable coefficients, which are named metropolis coefficients due to the originality and similarity of the metropolis probability in the simulated annealing, are presented as nonlinear functions of the generation of particles and the distances from each particle to the private and social optimal position in the problem space. This approach about the Metropolis coefficients is not only the graft but the fusion of PSO and simulated annealing. The application tests show that the improved PSO with the Metropolis coefficients can get the optimal position in the problem space by using less iteration steps than the traditional PSO, and the added computation of the variable coefficients does not increase the single iteration computing time much. So the new metropolis coefficients can save both the iteration and time of the optimization computing of PSO.},

Additionally, it is shown that dHPSO is able to adapt to the size of the search domain without the need for parameter tuning. Experiments that are conducted on a range of dynamic problems show that dHPSO consistently produces lower average errors than charged and quantum swarms over 2000 iterations, suggesting that dHPSO is a suitable algorithm for optimization in dynamic environments.},

To improve the search performance, when the search areas of two swarms are overlapped, the worse swarm will be removed. Moreover, in order to quickly track the changes in the environment, When a changes is revealed in surrounding environment, it causes swarms to be divided into two main parts, the first one is the particles in which are spread up randomly in whole space and then will be clustered to regroup. In the second group, all particles in the swarms convert to quantum particles.

Empirically, the algorithm achieves an time complexity of O(n) averaged over random problem instances. The planning algorithm is capable of solving approximately 97% of planning tasks in the general state space of configurations containing less than 20,000 units. The state space is divided into two classes according to planning efficiency. The configurations belonging to the first class permit an Euler tour to be wrapped around the robotic aggregate. The existence of the Euler tour implies units are free to move around the perimeter of the SRS. Planning between configurations in this class can be performed in O(n) using a specialized planning algorithm. The set of Euler tour configurations span a large volume of the general state space of the hexagonal SRS. A second specialized planning algorithm plans from a general configuration to a nearby Euler tour configuration. While planning in the general configuration state space is computationally harder, the distance required to plan is short. Thus, the combination of both algorithms allows us to efficiently plan for a large proportion of possible reconfiguration tasks for the hexagonal metamorphic robot.},

The model is composed of modules whose functinalities are inspired by corresponding brain regions responsible for the control of movement in primates. These modules are high-level abstractions of the spinal cord, the primary and premotor cortexes (M1 and PM), the cerebellum, and the temporal cortex. Each module is modeled at a connectionist level. Neurons in PM respond both to visual observation of movements and to corresponding motor commands produced by the cerebellum. As such, they give an abstract representation of mirror neurons. Learning of new combinations of movements is done in PM and in the cerebellum. Premotor cortexes and cerebellum are modeled by the DRAMA neural architecture which allows learning of times series and of spatio-temporal invariance in multimodal inputs. The model is implemented in a mechanical simulation of two humanoid avatars, the imitator and the imitatee. Three types of sequences learning are presented: (1) learning of repetitive patterns of arm and leg movements; (2) learning of oscillatory movements of shoulders and elbows, using video data of a human demonstration; 3) learning of precise movements of the extremities for grasp and reach.

However, almost all these robots were controlled using trajectory planning methods, and few robots realized giant-swing motion by learning. Consequently, in this study, we attempted to construct a humanoid robot that realizes giant-swing motion by Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique. The significant aspect of our study is that few robotic models were constructed beforehand; the robot learns giant-swing motion only by interaction with the environment during simulations. Our implementation faced several problems such as imperfect perception of the velocity state and robot posture issues caused by using only the arm angle. However, our real robot realized giant-swing motion by averaging the Q value and by using rewards - the absolute angle of the foot angle and the angular velocity of the arm angle-in the simulated learning data; the sampling time was 250 ms. Furthermore, the feasibility of generalization of learning for realizing selective motion in the forward and backward rotational directions was investigated; it was revealed that the generalization of learning is feasible as long as it does not interfere with the robot's motions.},
